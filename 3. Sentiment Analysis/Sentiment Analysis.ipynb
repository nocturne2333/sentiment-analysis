       "  'text': 'On October 22 in Garut, West Java, a member of the Barisan Ansor Serbaguna (Banser) youth movement burned a flag of Hizb ut-Tahrir Indonesia (HTI), an organization banned in Indonesia. A short video of the incident immediately went viral and was then quickly picked up by opposition-oriented TV channels. Islamic hardliners speedily demanded that the flag burners be tried for blasphemy. Meanwhile, police arrested three people involved in the burning, but they were quickly released.\\n\\nThis seemingly small incident is the first shot in the use of religion, specifically accusations of blasphemy, against President Jokowi in the ongoing presidential race. It is also a challenge to the Humanitarian Islam movement and the moderation of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the world’s largest Muslim organization.\\n\\nBanser is the militia wing of Ansor, which is NU’s young adult wing. The notion of an Islamic militia certainly sounds worrying to Westerners. But Banser is a good organization, and I have been talking with its senior leaders over the last few days. Its members are required to be unarmed and to coordinate all their actions with the police. They also guard churches in times of unrest.\\n\\nSeventy thousand Banser members were traveling to Yogyakarta on 1,400 buses for the launch of an interfaith movement dedicated to counter extremism worldwide and for a celebration of national unity that was due to culminate on October 26 in a rally of 100,000, including your humble correspondent, at which Jokowi was going to speak. The members were told to expect provocations along the way and were instructed to hand over any inciting materials to the police. With the exception of the one incident in Garut, these instructions were followed.\\n\\nDetails are murky, but the Garut incident has the smell of a setup. Yahya Cholil Staquf, head of Ansor and general secretary of Nahdlatul Ulama, said that as part of a campaign of “provocation and sabotage,” Hizb ut-Tahrir personnel disrupted the youth wing’s celebrations, which then led to the flag burning incident.\\n\\nHizb ut-Tahrir was banned in Indonesia in 2017 because of its call for an Islamic caliphate to replace the government of Indonesia. Waving its flag may even be illegal. But that flag also contains the Shahada, the Muslim confession of faith, so burning it would also involve burning a sacred text. The ambiguities of a sacred text blazoned on the flag of a banned organization open the door to demagogy.\\n\\nMany were outraged by the video and accused the Banser members of blasphemy. West Java Governor Ridwan Kamil stated that he regretted the incident: “They were supposed to burn the symbol of an organization that had been banned by the government, but in my opinion, [the act] triggered a different interpretation.” The semi-official Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) criticized Banser for the incident and said it should apologize, but did not call for any punishments.\\n\\nOn October 26, thousands of conservative Muslims took to the streets, and there were demonstrations throughout the country demanding the flag burners be prosecuted. There were rallies at the office of the senior minister responsible for legal affairs. Many demonstrators carried the black-and-white flag and chanted the creed written on it.\\n\\nYahya Staquf told me, “Further provocations were planned and some of our members would find it difficult to control their anger in the face of flagrant exploitation of our religious symbols.” To prevent further conflict and possible violence, especially at a gathering of 100,000 people, organizers canceled the mass rally and a dinner with the sultan of Yogyakarta, who is also the provincial governor.\\n\\nOne of the major groups behind these demonstrations is the National Movement to Safeguard the Indonesian Ulema Council’s Fatwa (GNPF). Its chairman, Yusuf Martak, demanded that the Ansor chairman, Yaqut Cholil Qoumas, be prosecuted for the flag-burning incident. GNPF was one of the major organizers of the campaign to accuse former Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (Ahok) of blasphemy. Ahok lost his election and was sentenced to two years in prison.\\n\\nWhat we are seeing now is an attempted reprise of the political manipulation of Islam, and specifically of blasphemy charges, that were used in the 2017 election for governor of Jakarta, but now at the national level. Since Jokowi was due to address the mass rally, the accusations are an attempt to taint him by association. They are also an attempt to taint NU, which will take no position on the election but whose members are often thought to be mostly Jokowi supporters, and whose former chairman of the supreme council is now Jokowi’s vice-presidential running mate.\\n\\nThe accusations were also a direct attempt to disrupt the Second Global Unity Forum, the Kirab Satu Negeri, an international gathering of Muslims and non-Muslims held jointly with the unity rally in order to promulgate standards for Humanitarian Islam. The Forum’s statement was drafted before the flag burning and subsequent agitprop, but it speaks directly to them in its goal to “prevent the political weaponization of Islam, whether by Muslims or non-Muslims, and to curtail the spread of communal hatred.”\\n\\nThe blasphemy accusations against Ahok divided the country, and those wounds are still raw. Now, the same tactics are being used again. There are nearly six months until the election on April 17, 2019, and those months will be fraught ones.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'By Anugerah Andriansyah and Eva Mazrieva\\n\\nNORTH SUMATRA, INDONESIA — Authorities in a North Sumatra village have banned three HIV-positive orphans from elementary school, and threatened the children, who are from outside the area, with expulsion from Nainggolan due to community fears of transmission.\\n\\nThe children, a boy and two girls, aged 7 to 11 years, were infected by transmission from their mothers, Berlina Sibagariang, executive secretary of the Batak Protestant Christian Huria AIDS Committee (HKBP), told VOA Indonesia. The orphaned children attended preschool and the Nainggolan State Primary School in North Sumatra for one day before they were expelled, in response to outcry from students and parents who learned of their HIV status, according to Sibagariang.\\n\\n“We want those three children to enjoy their rights to go to school and get an education,” Sibagariang said, adding “the community hopes that the children will no longer attend local schools. They are afraid that their children will be infected with HIV.”\\n\\nThe children were removed from classes on Oct. 22, and Sibagariang said the local community set an October 25 deadline for the children to leave the village.\\n\\nTake action: Share the Facts and Join the Fight to End HIV!\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile an estimated 5 million people are infected with HIV in Asia, the rate of new infections has slowed in the last decade. But not in Indonesia, which now has an estimated 660,000 people living with HIV, according to the UNAIDS. According to the UN agency, Indonesia had 48,000 new HIV infections and 38,000 AIDS-related deaths in 2016, an increase in AIDS-related deaths of 68% from 2010. As of 2016, an estimated 3,200 Indonesian children were infected with HIV due to mother-to-child transmission.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is, Indonesians activists note, ignorance of HIV and its transmission.\\n\\n“Many people in our rural area still don’t really know what HIV/AIDS is, or the regulations covering it,” Puta Elvina, commissioner of Indonesia’s National Commission to Protect Children (KPAI) told VOA. In Nainggolan, “the school should educate the [Parent Teachers Association (PTA)] about HIV/AIDS so they know they don’t have to worry about it. [The PTA} should communicate to them how people become infected, how HIV is transmitted, etc. And the school has an obligation to those HIV-kids, to protect and support them. Actually not only the school, but also the local people (to support the kids) and the local government.”\\n\\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can only be transmitted from an infected person to another through direct contact of bodily fluids such as blood (including menstrual blood), semen, vaginal secretions and breast milk, according to the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, a leading US source of information on HIV and AIDS. “Blood contains the highest concentration of the virus, followed by semen, followed by vaginal fluids, followed by breast milk. … It is possible for an HIV-infected mother to transmit HIV before or during birth or through breast milk. Breast milk contains HIV, and while small amounts of breast milk do not pose significant threat of infection to adults, it is a risk for infants.”\\n\\nThe shunning behavior in Nainggolan is not unique. “HIV stigma is effectively universal, but its form varies from one country to another, and the specific groups targeted for AIDS stigma vary considerably,” says the University of California, Davis. “Whatever its form, HIV stigma inflicts suffering on people and interferes with attempts to fight the AIDS epidemic.”\\n\\nTiqoh, who has only one name, is an activist at Yayasan Pelita Ilmu (YPI), a non-governmental organization with a long track record on HIV/AIDS education in Indonesia, understands the difficulty of talking about HIV “with the local people, but perhaps the school could also involve doctors from the local clinic. Those parents and local people who refuse to take care these kids, or don’t want them to study in the same class as their children, they’re taking these actions because they don’t know much about HIV/AIDS. They’re just worry that their kids might be infected.”\\n\\nHKBP is continuing talks with local government officials and the community as the Thursday deadline approaches in an attempt to stop expulsion of the children from Nainggolan.\\n\\n“They said that we should remove those children because the local government hasn’t issued a permit to send children to those schools or even stay in that village,” said Sibagariang. “In fact, the home in that village – where we sent the children – is our home, an HKBP home. They have right to stay there. It’s our home!”\\n\\nLocal leader, Samosir Regent Rapidin Simbolon, told VOA that the HKBP hospital in Nainggolan once “accommodated the elderly, but now they accommodate children who are exposed to HIV.”\\n\\nRead More: Hunger Is Linked to Testing Positive for HIV in South Africa, Says New Study\\n\\nSo far, the talks have resulted in a suggestion to homeschool the children but the HKBP AIDS Committee rejected this option, saying it would isolate the children and paper over what they see as the real issue: misunderstanding of HIV-AIDS.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe committee criticized another local leader, Samosir Deputy Regent, Juang Sinaga, who called for the children to be expelled from the village, and sent to the jungle.\\n\\nRapidin told VOA \"I am responsible,” he said. “I will not allow the public to directly shun them. … We will protect (the children) so no one will take advantage of the situation. Be assured we are protecting them, we will even involve the police, if necessary. I guarantee that the children are being monitored.”\\n\\nBut the regent said that there were different opinions about the orphans–parents don’t want their children in classes with the HIV-positive orphans, “while HKBP who said that [separating these children] is discriminating against HIV-people.”\\n\\n“The HKBP does not want to understand us,” Rapidin said. “The three children who are positive are not from our region. They come from outside. We are actually very tolerant, it\\'s OK here. But they (HKBP) are insistent. The HKBP cannot insist like that. Nainggolan residents also have rights.\"\\n\\nAnugerah Andriansyah reported from North Sumatra, Indonesia and Eva Mazrieva reported from Washington, DC.'},\n",

As of now we expect of them to openly bring to light those responsible — from the highest ranked to the lowest — and to bring them to justice,” the Turkish president said.\\n\\nErdogan’s speech was previously pitched as revealing the “naked truth” about Khashoggi’s slaying. Instead it served merely to put a named source to information already circulated by anonymous officials and the Turkish press in the days since the columnist for The Washington Post walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.\\n\\nHowever, he kept pressure on the kingdom with his demands for Turkish prosecution of the suspects as well as punishment for the plot’s masterminds.\\n\\nWATCH: Saudi delegation enter parking lot where forensics search Saudi Consulate vehicle\\n\\n“All evidence gathered shows that Jamal Khashoggi was the victim of a savage murder. To cover up such a savagery would hurt the human conscience,” he said.\\n\\nErdogan didn’t mention Saudi Arabia’s assertive Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in his speech, though officials linked to the royal have been implicated in the killing. The kingdom has said the heir-apparent of the world’s top oil exporter was not involved, but any major decision must be signed off by the highest powers within its ruling Al Saud family.\\n\\nHe asked: “where is the body of Jamal Khashoggi?”\\n\\nInternational skepticism has intensified since Saudi Arabia said on Saturday that Khashoggi died in a brawl. The case has shocked the world and raised suspicions that a Saudi hit squad planned Khashoggi’s killing after he walked into the consulate on Oct. 2, and then attempted to cover it up.\\n\\nBefore Erdogan’s announcement, top Turkish officials said Turkey would clarify exactly what happened to Khashoggi and a stream of leaks to national and international media has increased pressure on Saudi Arabia, which is hosting a glitzy investment conference this week that many dignitaries have decided to skip because of the scandal.\\n\\n\\n\\nREAD MORE:\\n\\nSaudi dissident in Quebec says people who ordered Khashoggi’s killing were also after him\\n\\n\\n\\nSaudi Arabia said it arrested suspects and that several top intelligence officials were fired over the killing, but critics alleged that the punishment was designed to absolve Prince Mohammed of any responsibility.\\n\\nOn Monday, leaked surveillance video showed a man strolling out of the diplomatic post hours after Khashoggi disappeared into the consulate, apparently wearing the columnist’s clothes as part of a macabre deception to sow confusion over his fate.\\n\\nThe new video broadcast by CNN, as well as a pro-government Turkish newspaper’s report that a member of Prince Mohammed’s entourage made four calls to the royal’s office from the consulate around the same time, put more pressure on the kingdom.

An estimated 2.3 million of them work in households, often as maids.\\n\\nBut foreign workers often run afoul of Saudi Arabia’s legal system, which is based on a strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law. Just last week, Saudi Arabia arrested 19 workers from the Philippines after a raid on a Halloween party in Riyadh, according to local media reports.\\n\\nThe workers were released Tuesday, according to the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs, which also noted that they may still face charges, as public interaction between unattached men and women is prohibited in Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nActivists say migrant workers in Saudi Arabia can be exploited under its visa sponsorship system, known as kafala.

In 2015, Indonesia had banned domestic workers from traveling to 21 Middle Eastern countries after reports of abuse.\\n\\nAccording to Amnesty International, Saudi Arabia executed 146 people in 2017 — making it the world’s third most prolific executioner after China and Iran. At least four Indonesians have been executed in Saudi Arabia since 2011.

Mount Soputan in North Sulawesi province spewed ash 6,000 meters (19,700 feet) into the sky Wednesday morning. No evacuations were immediately ordered.\\n\\nAdvertising\\n\\nA government volcanologist said it’s possible the eruption was accelerated by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake in Central Sulawesi on Friday. “It could be that this earthquake triggered the eruption, but the direct correlation has yet to be seen as there had been an increase in the Mount Soputan activity,” Kasbani, the head of Indonesia’s Vulcanology and Geology Disaster Mitigation agency, told online news portal Tempo.\\n\\nKasbani, who uses one name, said volcanic activity had been increasing at Soputan since August and began surging Monday. Nazli Ismail, a geophysicist at University of Syiah Kuala, Banda Aceh on Sumatra island, stressed there was no concrete evidence to show they are linked.\\n\\n“People talk about the butterfly effect. The concept is that when a butterfly flaps its wings, it can cause a catastrophe,” he said. “So it is possible for the earthquake to trigger the volcano eruption, but it’s not conclusive. This needs to be further investigated.” Nazri said the Soputan volcano eruption isn’t surprising as Indonesia sits on the seismically active Pacific “Ring of Fire,” and Soputan is one of the most active volcanoes on the island.\\n\\nAdvertising\\n\\nSoputan’s eruption status was raised from an alert to standby 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from the summit and up to 6.5 kilometers to the west-southwest. Standby status means the public should avoid the area nearest the volcano and have masks available in the event of ashfall. Planes were warned of the ash clouds because volcanic ash is hazardous for their engines.\\n\\nThe earthquake in Central Sulawesi set off a tsunami and has devastated several communities. Indonesia is an archipelago of more than 250 million people and government seismologists monitor more than 120 active volcanoes.\\n\\nAccording to a notification issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Tirap, Changlang and Longding districts of Arunachal Pradesh and eight police stations bordering Assam were declared “disturbed” areas under the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), 1958. “Now, therefore, Tirap, Changlang and Longding districts in Arunachal Pradesh and the areas falling within the jurisdiction of the following eight police stations in the districts of Arunachal Pradesh, bordering the State of Assam, are declared as ‘disturbed area’ under Section 3 of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 up to March 31, 2019 w.e.f. October 1, 2018, unless withdrawn earlier,” the notification said.\\n\\nThe police stations include Balemu and Bhalukpong police stations in West Kameng district, Seijosa police station in East Kameng district, Balijan police station in Papumpare district, Namsai and Mahadevpur police stations in Namsai district, Roing police station in Lower Dibang Valley district and Sunpura police station in Lohit district.\\n\\nThe decision was taken following a review of the law and order situation in the three districts and eight police station areas concerned, a home ministry official said.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Beginning October 1965 to mid-1966, at least half a million (over a million by some accounts) Indonesians were killed by the army and army-backed local civilian militias. Another million were incarcerated without charge.\\n\\nThe mass murder of genocidal proportions was justified on tenuous, even non-existent, links between an alleged coup d\\'état attempt (called the September 30 Movement or the G30S) and the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). In the G30S the Indonesian army, backed by the US and UK, saw the perfect pretext for annihilating the PKI and seizing state power. Charging the organisation as a whole with treason, the army embarked on a systematic killing of communists.\\n\\nThis paved the way for the military dictatorship of Major General Suharto and his New Order, which would last for 31 years. Two decades after Suharto\\'s fall from power, many details of the G30S and the subsequent mass killings remain unknown, justice is nowhere in sight, and many of the perpetrators remain politically powerful.\\n\\n***\\n\\n\"The military demonized and dehumanized millions of people by setting up a chain of associations: the movement equals the PKI equals every person associated with the PKI equals absolute evil.\"\\n\\n- John Roosa, Pretext for Mass Murder\\n\\nThe PKI was formed in 1920, and is considered the oldest communist party in Asia. By the 1950s it had moved towards a parliamentary path and enjoyed widespread popularity in the grassroots. Its unprecedented success in the elections of 1955 came as a shock to not only the rightist and Islamist parties in the country, but to the army as well. After 1957, when the country\\'s founding president and independence leader Sukarno established his Guided Democracy to bring stability to a fledgling state, the PKI stepped away from electoral politics to one of mass mobilisation, and even had the president\\'s ear. By 1965, it had around 3.5 million card-carrying members and another 20 million through affiliated organisations. After China and Russia, this was the largest and most organised communist party in the world.\\n\\nThe political atmosphere of the time was highly-charged, and the army was deeply-politicised. In the backdrop of the Cold War, Sukarno was seen as moving ever closer to the left; with strong ties to China, threats of nationalising Western industries, and increasingly anti-imperialist rhetoric, he together with the PKI was a threat to the army\\'s interests, and to the US and the UK, which were already wary of another country in the East falling to communism.\\n\\nIn this tensed atmosphere, rumours began to circulate in 1965 that within the army, a Council of Generals were plotting to overthrow Sukarno with the aid of foreign intelligence agencies. It is in this backdrop that the G30S movement started, through the kidnapping of six top generals of the Indonesian army in the early hours of October 1. In a botched-up execution of the kidnapping, many details of which are not known for certain, the six generals and one adjutant were killed. The bodies of all seven men were dumped in a well. In the meantime, troops mobilised by the movement had seized control of key locations, including the national radio station. Around 7:00 am, a radio broadcast publicly announced that a movement had started, led by a battalion commander of the Presidential Guard, to safeguard the president and to foil a planned coup against the state by the CIA-backed Council of Generals. The announcement also stated that the G30S was an internal army affair, carried out by officers loyal to Sukarno.\\n\\nIn the meantime, the core leadership of the G30S, three army personnel, and two civilians, Sjam and Pono, both allegedly part of a clandestine organisation of the Communist Party within the army, had assembled at an air force base. D N Aidit, the chairman of the Communist Party was at the base as well. Soon to join them was President Sukarno, who had learned of the kidnapping on his way to the presidential palace. What conversation took place between the G30S leaders and the president remains speculative, but for whatever reason, Sukarno did not back the movement as had been expected.\\n\\nThe movement clearly had not gone according to plan. For one, it was most likely the intention of the movement to kidnap the generals unharmed and bring them before the president as proof of the existence of the Council of Generals, and thus secure Sukarno\\'s approval for the whole thing.\\n\\nWithin a matter of days all traces of the movement were wiped out, rebel troops were captured, the leaders were on the run, and the army had taken over effective control. This is where Major General Suharto, the then commander of the army strategic reserve, came in. According to witnesses in the trials later, Suharto had been told of the plot to kidnap the generals the day before—he had kept quiet and was actually considered an ally. After the news of the death of the generals reached him, he had himself declared as the head of the armed forces. He quickly neutralised the few armed units loyal to the G30S, and wrested authority from the president to \"restore security and order\". The leaders of the G30S, failing to come to a decision about putting up a fight, decided to flee.\\n\\nWhen the bodies of the murdered generals were discovered, Suharto spun the story into one of barbarity of the PKI, which he claimed was trying to take over state power. He called on the population\\'s help to assist the army in crushing the PKI \"down to the very roots\". By this time, all newspapers had been either closed or brought under army control. False stories about torture of the generals before they were killed and about Gerwani (the Indonesian Women\\'s Movement, allied to the PKI) activists dancing naked during the killings began to appear in the media.\\n\\nThe slow-killing coup by Suharto began with the founding myth of the PKI\\'s betrayal. The campaign to decimate communists across the country started, while the army maintained that it had nothing to do with the mass violence and killings—that this was the result of the anger of the general people. Historian John Roosa, in his book, Pretext for Mass Murder, writes: \"Instead of attacking the palace first, Suharto attacked the society with a thunderclap of violence and then, treading over a fearful, confused populace, effortlessly entered the palace.\" By 1967, Sukarno, whose influence and power was being slowly taken away, was finally deposed, and Major General Suharto emerged as the president of Indonesia.\\n\\n***\\n\\n\"They called this, \\'The People\\'s Struggle.\\'... to protect their image they [the army] made it look like the people exterminated the communists. But everybody knows the Army was behind it.\"\\n\\n- Former Death Squad Leader, The Look of Silence\\n\\nThe violence that followed, despite the army\\'s claims, was not spontaneous. It was actively encouraged and abetted by the army leadership. \"Under Suharto\", writes Roosa, \"anticommunism became the state religion.\" Every propaganda method, from textbooks, monuments, streets names, films, museums, rituals and national holidays was used to continuously link the PKI as a whole to the killings of the generals.\\n\\nGeoffrey B Robinson, an UCLA professor of the history of political violence and genocide, in his 2018 book The Killing Season: A History of the Indonesian Massacre, 1965-66, dispels meticulously the narrative of \"spontaneous mass violence\", and the Orientalist notion that Indonesians are prone as a people to violent outbursts. He writes: \"Genocides do not simply happen—they are not natural by-products of socio-economic or cultural conflicts—but instead are the result of deliberate and conscious acts by political and military leaders.\"\\n\\nThe core organisers of the G30S were captured not long after they had tried to make an escape. They were put on special military trials, and summarily executed. These trials, and those of communists as they were being arrested across the country, were used to whip up anti-PKI rhetoric, and based on lists supplied by the army, communist members were rounded up at night and taken by truck to killing sites. Most of those rounded up were not political figures, but poor and lower-middle class people—landless farmers, factory workers, students, civil servants, and the ethnic Chinese.\\n\\nWithout ever having been convicted of any crime, with no involvement, direct or indirect, with the events of October 1, they were killed in the most barbaric ways using sickles, knives, machetes spears and so on, and were dumped in rivers or mass graves that they were first made to dig. Local militia groups, formed of members of religious groups of all faiths (because they saw the PKI as atheists), rightist parties, and civilians too scared of being branded as communists carried out these killings. The land-owning class, who feared PKI\\'s advocated land reforms, too joined in. Women activists of the Gerwani were targets of sexual violence, mutilation and rape, before murder. The army remained in the shadows of these vigilante militias, all the while using propaganda and psychological tactics to mobilise the population, providing training to death squads, and helping with logistics.\\n\\nAs Robinson explores in his book, the army created a situation, through use of language and ritual, where people truly believed that communists and anyone remotely associated needed to be killed—it was a patriotic and religious duty to do so. The million or more who were not killed, were interned in gulag-like conditions. Many died of starvation, torture or disease.\\n\\n***\\n\\n\"A premature PKI coup may be the most helpful solution for the West—provided the coup failed.\"\\n\\n- British foreign office note on a report about Indonesia, December 1964\\n\\nThe demonisation of the PKI rested on a matter of interpretation. The radio announcements of October 1 stressed that the G30S was an internal army affair, and not a move to seize state power. But, the presence of two underground communist party members and the chairman of the PKI gave some traction on which the army\\'s propaganda efforts built through subsequent \"testimonies\" obtained after torture of other PKI members. But one important question that challenges this narrative of the PKI trying to seize state power is that of motive. The PKI was a legal party enjoying success at the time. Why would it risk it all? State Department cables from around the time raise the same doubt. Since then, a number of interpretations have surfaced: from those blaming the army for staging the coup to foreign instigation or role of double agents.\\n\\nBoth Roosa and Robinson, after analysis, come to similar conclusions: most importantly, not only was the PKI as a party not involved or aware of the G30S, even most top Politburo members had no notion of what was going on—there was no attempt whatsoever by the PKI to seize state power. In light of documents that have become available since then, one convincing explanation is that at most a handful of top members of the PKI were involved with the G30S, but this support was to pre-empt a coup on Sukarno by the Council of Generals, and thus give the president legitimacy for moving against the rightist elements in the military. Why Sukarno did not come on board we may never know for sure (one explanation put forward has been the unforeseen deaths of the generals), but even with diminished authority, he had tried, in vain, to give protection to people being killed all over the country and stop the flow of propaganda.\\n\\nAs mentioned before, the US had been on friendly terms with the army, and both had had a stake in seeing Sukarno go. Correspondence between the army, the US and the UK show that they had jointly come to the decision to drive the PKI into open opposition of the government, and then use that as a pretext for repressive measures. The army leadership benefitted from US investment that went into the millions, and the US wanted to retain influence on Indonesia. But, given the mass popularity Sukarno enjoyed, an open attempt was considered unwise. The coup would have to be \"disguised as its opposite: an effort to save President Sukarno\" (Roosa). Major General Suharto was most likely aware of this plan of waiting for a pretext. And because he was told of the G30S a day before, he knew he would emerge unscathed. The rest was for him to just set the plans in motion: blame the PKI and start the purge.\\n\\nThe army knew that international powers, if not openly, at least indirectly would support them. The US and the British settled on covert ways, detailed in both Roosa\\'s and Robinson\\'s books, to aid the destruction of the PKI. International media adopted an odd tone: even while stating nonchalantly that people were being killed on a horrific scale, it celebrated that communism had been defeated in the East.\\n\\n***\\n\\n\"Impunity is nothing without repetitive, boastful demonstrations to different audiences.\"\\n\\n- Benedict Anderson,\\n\\n\"The 1965 Massacre in Indonesia and Its Legacy\", Counterpunch, 2014\\n\\nIn his 2014 Oscar-nominated documentary The Look of Silence (and in its prequel The Act of Killing) director Joshua Oppenheimer revisited the mass murders of 1965 through talking to killers and collaborators who had joined the militia groups. What makes these films surreal is the complete lack of guilt on the parts of the murderers—on cue, they are happy to re-enact for Joshua\\'s camera exactly how and where they carried out the killings, talking openly about the sexual violence they committed, going into gory details, while at the same time either denying responsibility or maintaining they had committed no crime. In one chilling scene in the Look of Silence, a schoolteacher explains to children why the communists were killed: \"To change the political system, the communists kidnapped six army generals. They sliced the general\\'s faces with razor blades ... Would you like that? Imagine how painful it would be if your eyes were gouged out. ... The communists were cruel. So, the Government had to repress them.\"\\n\\n***\\n\\n\"... an entire tradition of leftist thinking, writing, and political action that was so central to the construction of the modern Indonesian political identity and culture since the 1920s has been decimated and rendered illegitimate.\"\\n\\n- Geoffrey B Robinson,\\n\\nThe Killing Season: A History of the Indonesian Massacre, 1965-66\\n\\nUS support for the army only came to an end with the Carter administration and the international human rights movement of the 70s. And though since the years of Suharto\\'s fall, there have been attempts at reconciliation and justice, they have been met with fierce resistance from political leaders and army veterans. The deep mistrust, and formal ban, against the left remains. Robinson writes that as of 2017, no truth commission had been established, and no significant efforts had been made to exhume mass graves and ensure proper burials of the victims. Roosa\\'s book was banned in the country for a time. Screenings of Oppenheimer\\'s films witnessed violence. \"While a monument stands next to the well in which the movement\\'s troops dumped the bodies of seven army officers ... no monument marks any of the mass graves that hold the hundreds of thousands of people killed in the name of supressing the movement,\" writes Roosa in ending the book. Yet, more Indonesians today are starting to question the army\\'s carefully-crafted lie. But, where dissent to the official stance was till very recently met with terrible consequences, how long it will take for a modicum of justice to appear, is anybody\\'s guess.\\n\\nMoyukh Mahtab is a member of the editorial team, The Daily Star.\\n\\nFollow The Daily Star Opinion on Facebook for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.'},\n",

The big cat is one of a number of rare species sought after by poachers in Indonesia.\\n\\nA court in Indonesia’s Aceh province has sentenced two men to four years behind bars for attempting to sell a tiger skin, in the toughest ever penalty handed down for a wildlife crime there.\\n\\nSarkawi Bin Warigo, 41, and Sabaruddin Bin M. Yusak, 45, were arrested last July. During the trial, they refused to be accompanied by a lawyer, court records show. In addition to the jail sentence handed down on Oct. 18, the court also ordered them to pay 50 million rupiah ($3,300) each in fines or serve an additional four months in jail.\\n\\nThe two men were arrested at Sabaruddin’s parents’ house in South Aceh district during a deal in which they acted as middlemen. The man who provided the tiger skin to Sarkawi, identified only as Fanji, a co-worker at the oil palm plantation where Sarkawi was employed, remains at large and is on the police’s wanted list. Also being pursued by police is a third middleman, identified as Munzir, with whom Sabaruddin planned to sell the pelt to an unidentified buyer for 50 million rupiah.\\n\\nSapto Aji Prabowo, head of the Aceh branch of the government’s Natural Resources Conservation Agency (BKSDA), commended the prosecution’s handling of the case, but warned the trade would continue if demand for animal parts went unaddressed.\\n\\n“We’re still finding animal snares during our forest patrols,” he said. “If the buyers aren’t caught, [the tigers] will keep being hunted.”\\n\\nFewer than 400 Sumatran tigers (Panthera tigris sumatrae) remain in the wild, according to the WWF. Dozens of the critically endangered cats are killed every year by poachers, with tiger parts a prized ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine. Their skins are sought after as ornamental objects as well.\\n\\nThe conviction by the court in Aceh came just a day after a court in Lampung, another province on the island of Sumatra, sentenced five men to three years in prison and fined them 50 million rupiah each for a similar offense. Three of the men trapped and killed a tiger in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and home to a tenth of all remaining Sumatran tigers, before cutting it up and selling the parts to the two other defendants.\\n\\nLast year, two tiger-skin traders in Riau province, also in Sumatra, were sentenced to four years in prison.\\n\\nIndonesia’s 1990 Conservation Law allows for a maximum five-year jail sentence for wildlife crimes. Conservationists say the sentencing guidelines are in dire need of change. Light sentences are common and this fails to deter traffickers, they say. Efforts have been made to revise the law to allow for harsher sentencing.\\n\\nDwi Adhiasto, program manager of the Wildlife Crime Unit, an initiative in Indonesia of the Wildlife Conservation Society, said the latest court ruling still wasn’t enough to deter other traffickers. He cited a separate case where a tiger trafficker served a two-year sentence and then picked up where he left off after leaving prison.\\n\\n“That’s proof that the risk they take is outweighed by the benefits they receive [from the trade],” he said.\\n\\nThis story was reported in part by Mongabay’s Indonesia team and was first published on our Indonesian site on May 15, 2017.\\n\\nFEEDBACK: Use this form to send a message to the author of this post.

       "  'text': 'Say cheese—and watch out for that jagged cliff behind you.\\n\\nA group of health researchers in India have tried to tally the death toll from selfie taking, counting 259 deaths worldwide from October 2011 to November 2017. In doing so, they also caught a blurry glimpse of the leading ways in which people perish during dicey photo ops. The top three were drowning, transportation related (mostly being hit by trains), and falling off of things, such as cliff edges.\\n\\nFor their snapshot of fatal photography, the researchers used the somewhat shaky method of simple Google searches, scanning the web for media reports on selfie-related deaths. The researchers—a group from All India Institute of Medical Sciences, which is a collective of public medical colleges in the country—published their results recently in the obscure India-based Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care.\\n\\nThe resulting grim picture shows a developing public health threat, the researchers argue. Yet, the numbers are likely “just the tip of iceberg,” they add. Selfies are never recorded as an official cause of death, media reports don’t report every death, and the search was limited to English-language news reports.\\n\\nStill, the researchers were able to catch a reasonable peek into the perilous photo trends. The 259 deaths resulted from 137 ill-fated photo clicks during the time period surveyed. The death rate seemed to increase over that time, with three and two death reports in 2011 and 2013, respectively, and nearly 100 each in 2016 and 2017.\\n\\nRisk-taking men accounted for 72.5 percent of the fatalities with gender data. Of those with age data, the mean age was about 23 years old. The majority of deaths were of those aged 10 to 29.\\n\\nIndia had the most deaths in the survey, with 159. That was followed by 16 in Russia, 14 in the US, and 11 in Pakistan. The rest were scattered in various countries.\\n\\nThe top way to go while snapping a self-portrait was drowning. This includes being washed away by waves on a beach, capsizing in a boat, and getting into picturesque water while not knowing how to swim. Transportation came next, with the biggest risk being clicking a pic in front of a moving train. Selfie deaths from falls and fires followed, along with animal mauling, electrocution, and firearms. Most of the fatalities involving pics with firearms occurred in the US.\\n\\nOverall, the researchers blamed the deadly images on tourists and youths trying too hard to “be cool” and take pictures that will garner likes and comments on social media. To combat the trend, they recommend that officials in various countries declare “no selfie zones” in hazardous sightseeing areas, such as along bodies of water, mountain peaks, and the tops of tall buildings. They note that officials in Mumbai, Russia, and Indonesia are already taking steps to limit selfies in places with dangerous backdrops.\\n\\nJournal of Family Medicine and Primary Care, 2018.

But the nation’s experience with deadly natural phenomena wasn\\'t over, as Mount Soputan erupted on Wednesday.\\n\\nSoputan, located on Sulawesi Island, erupted twice. The first eruption occurred at 8:47 a.m. local time, and the second followed at 11:12 a.m., according to The Jakarta Post.\\n\\nIndonesia’s Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation cautioned residents to stay outside of a 2.5-mile radius from the volcano’s peak because of the possible presence of lava and ash.\\n\\n“Residents are advised to use dust masks to avoid any potential respiratory problems in the event of falling ash,” the warning said, according to The Jakarta Post.\\n\\nThe eruption spewed ash more than 19,000 feet into the sky, USA Today reported, and evacuations were ordered for people living within a few miles of the volcano. Photos and videos posted on social media show smoke billowing into the sky from the mountain’s peak.\\n\\nSoputan’s activity occurred only a few days after the island was hit with two large quakes. Last Friday afternoon, a magnitude 6.1 earthquake hit Donggala, a regency on Sulawesi Island. The quake, which lasted about 10 seconds, killed one person and injured at least 10 others.\\n\\nAbout four hours after the first quake struck, a second tremor, this time a magnitude 7.5, also hit the Sulawesi Island, about 550 miles from Donggala. A tsunami warning was issued for the island but was canceled shortly after it was issued. However, after its cancellation a powerful wave hit Palu, the provincial capital.\\n\\nJEWEL SAMAD/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nBetween the earthquakes and the tsunami, more than 1,400 people were killed, according to The Washington Post. In addition to the massive number of deaths, an estimated 70,000 people have been displaced, National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told the Post.\\n\\nDuring the tsunami, 5-year-old Akbar and his mother and siblings were on the beach, according to Channel 4 News. He was swept away from the rest of his family and spent days in a hospital, unsure of what had become of his family. His mother, Wahtin, assumed her 5-year-old son had died in the wave. By sheer coincidence, she was brought to the same hospital as her son, and the two were reunited.\\n\\n“He’s in this condition because of this disaster,” a nurse told Channel 4 News about Akbar’s shock.\\n\\nThe tsunami forced torrents of water and mud to rush through streets, swallowing up cars, homes and people. Entire neighborhoods were destroyed, and experts told CNN that soil liquefaction was to blame.\\n\\n\"During the earthquake, water pressure is generated in the soil, which causes a dramatic loss of strength,\" said Jonathan Stewart, a professor in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at the University of California, Los Angeles. \"The strength loss can be so great that the soil behaves almost like a liquid.\"\\n\\nSix days after the disasters, some residents are still in urgent need of food, water and medical supplies. To help aid relief efforts, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs allocated $15 million to Indonesia. The funds will be used both for supplies and to supplement medical care, since many health clinics were damaged.\\n\\n\"The government of Indonesia is experienced and well equipped in managing natural disasters, but sometimes, as with all other countries, outside help is also needed,\" U.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock said. \"Given the scale and complexity of this emergency, U.N. agencies and humanitarian organizations are working closely with government counterparts to provide life-saving assistance.”\\n\\nNo casualties have been reported in connection with Wednesday’s volcanic eruption, and it hasn’t been determined if it was caused by the recent earthquakes.'},\n",

The five-member International Emergency Firefighters team said late on Thursday its sensor \"detected the presence of a victim\" under thick concrete in the wreckage of the Mercure Hotel in Palu city. The device can identify breathing and heartbeats but gas leaks and other factors can result in false positives. The team stopped digging overnight but after an hour of searching Friday morning, team member Philip Besson said they could not find the signal again. \"We are perplexed and frustrated mostly. We strongly believed in it yesterday. Now we have nothing at all ... we tried everything and have no response,\" he said. Local rescuers were continuing to dig at the collapsed hotel. The French rescuers said on their Facebook page that 40 people including six workers are missing from the hotel. The death toll from Friday\\'s 7.5 magnitude earthquake that spawned a tsunami has risen to 1558, with scores more believed buried in deep mud and under debris of collapsed buildings and homes. The national disaster agency said the body of a South Korean man was among eight dead pulled on Thursday from the wreckage of another hotel in Palu, the Roa Roa, which collapsed sideways in a heap of cement and steel. Local television said the man, the only foreigner known to have perished in the disaster, was a paraglider taking part in an event in the area. Thousands have been injured and more than 70,000 evacuated to shelters and makeshift tents that have sprouted across Palu, the provincial capital of Sulawesi island that is home to most of the victims, and its surrounding areas. After days of initial chaos and looting by desperate survivors, some stability has returned to Palu with some shops reopened and electricity restored in some parts of the city. Transportation Minister Budi Karya Sumadi said five ships carrying more than 90,000 tonnes of supplies arrived in Palu port on Thursday and two more vessels on Friday. He said the Palu airport would also be resume operations for passenger planes soon. Military transport planes from Australia, India, Singapore, Malaysia and elsewhere have landed with relief goods.

Desperation was visible everywhere Tuesday among victims receiving little aid in areas heavily damaged by a massive earthquake and tsunami, four days after the disaster devastated parts of Indonesia's central Sulawesi island. (AP Photo/Dita Alangkara) (Photo: Dita Alangkara / AP)\\n\\nPALU, Indonesia — Trucks carrying food for desperate survivors of the earthquake on Indonesia’s Sulawesi island rolled in with a police escort Tuesday to guard against looters, while the death toll from the disaster soared past 1,200.\\n\\nFour days after the magnitude 7.5 earthquake and tsunami struck, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine had yet to reach the hardest-hit areas outside Palu, the largest city that was heavily damaged. Many roads in the earthquake zone are blocked and communications lines are down.\\n\\n“We feel like we are stepchildren here because all the help is going to Palu,” said Mohamad Taufik, 38, from the town of Donggala, where five of his relatives are still missing. “There are many young children here who are hungry and sick, but there is no milk or medicine.”\\n\\nDeath toll: The death toll reached 1,234, national disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in Jakarta, the capital. Hundreds of other people were injured, and scores of uncounted bodies could still be buried in collapsed buildings in Sigi and Balaroa under quicksand-like mud caused by Friday’s quake.\\n\\nThe U.N. humanitarian office reported that “needs are vast,” with people urgently requiring shelter, clean water, food, fuel and emergency medical care.\\n\\nWater is the main issue because most of the supply infrastructure has been damaged, U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York.\\n\\nMore than 25 countries offered assistance after Indonesian President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo appealed for international help. Little of that, however, has reached the disaster zone, and increasingly desperate residents grabbed food and fuel from damaged stores and begged for help.\\n\\nRelief: Haq said the government is coordinating emergency efforts, and U.N. and relief agencies are on the ground or en route. He said the agencies are working closely with the government to provide technical support.\\n\\nAn aircraft carrying 3,170 gallons of fuel had arrived, and trucks with food were on the way with police escorts to guard against looters. Many gas stations were inoperable either because of quake damage or from people stealing fuel, Nugroho said.\\n\\nThe frustration of waiting for days without help has angered some survivors.\\n\\n“Pay attention to Donggala, Mr. Jokowi. Pay attention to Donggala,” yelled one resident in a video broadcast on local TV, referring to the president. “There are still a lot of unattended villages here.”\\n\\nThe town’s administrative head, Kasman Lassa, all but gave residents permission to take food — but nothing else — from stores.\\n\\n“Everyone is hungry and they want to eat after several days of not eating,” Lassa said on local TV. “We have anticipated it by providing food, rice, but it was not enough. There are many people here. So, on this issue, we cannot pressure them to hold much longer.”\\n\\nNearly 62,000 people have been displaced from their homes, Nugroho said.\\n\\nMost of the attention has been focused so far on Palu, which has 380,000 people and is easier to reach than other hard-hit areas.\\n\\nMore aid was being distributed, but “we still need more time to take care of all the problems,” Nugroho said.\\n\\nSearching: Teams continued searching for survivors under destroyed homes and buildings, including a collapsed eight-story hotel in Palu, but they needed more heavy equipment to clear the rubble.\\n\\nMany people were believed trapped under shattered houses in the Palu neighborhood of Balaroa, where the earthquake caused the ground to heave up and down violently.\\n\\n“I and about 50 other people in Balaroa were able to save ourselves by riding on a mound of soil which was getting higher and higher,” resident Siti Hajat told MetroTV, adding that her house was destroyed.\\n\\nA handful of disaster personnel arrived in the neighborhood Tuesday morning. A lone backhoe cleared a path into the jumble of twisted buildings.\\n\\nSa’Adon Lawira, who lost a grandchild, was angry that rescue efforts focused so quickly on places such as the Palu hotel where tourists were staying.\\n\\n“Why did the search-and-rescue agency and others prioritize the search for victims in hotels?” he said, holding back tears as he spoke. “Neighborhoods like this should take precedence because the bodies of residents are buried, but there are no rescuers who have searched for them.”\\n\\nNear the coast, the tsunami shattered buildings, uprooted concrete and thrust boats inland. The deadly wave reportedly reached as high as nearly 20 feet in places.\\n\\nIn Palu’s Petobo neighborhood, the quake caused loose, wet soil to liquefy, creating a thick, heavy quicksand-type material that resulted in massive damage. Hundreds of victims are still believed to be buried in the mud there.\\n\\nLiquefaction of soil can be compared to walking on a sandy beach.\\n\\n“If you walk across some wet sand a little back from the water’s edge, it is usually firm walking, even though you might leave footprints,” said Adam Switzer, an expert at the Earth Observatory of Singapore. “However, if you stand still and wiggle your toes and feet, you will probably sink a little as the sand around your feet becomes soft and unstable. This is similar to what happens during liquefaction.”\\n\\nNugroho said 153 bodies were buried Monday in a mass grave in Palu and that the operation continued Tuesday.\\n\\nHe said generators, heavy equipment and tents are among the most-needed aid items. The countries that offered assistance include the United States and China, he said.\\n\\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said his government has given $360,000 to help victims and is in talks with Indonesian authorities about a second round of aid. The initial funds are to go to the Indonesian Red Cross for the most obvious emergency aid needs, such as tarpaulins.\\n\\nNugroho said only two of the 122 foreigners in the area remained unaccounted for – one from South Korea and the other from Belgium.\\n\\nThe U.N.’s Haq said the Indonesian Ministry of Social Affairs has asked the U.N. children’s agency, UNICEF, to send social workers to the affected area to support children who are alone or became separated from their families. And he said the World Health Organization is warning that a lack of shelter and damaged water sanitation facilities could lead to outbreaks of communicable diseases.\\n\\nIndonesia, a vast archipelago of 260 million people, is frequently struck by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis because of its location on the “Ring of Fire,” an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin.

       "  'text': \"Well that didn’t take long. It’s been less than a week since the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami on the island of Sulawesi robbed thousands of people of their lives, and only a couple of days since Soputan volcano, located on the very same island, erupted – and, already, misinformation is everywhere. As was expected, the usual outlets have conjured up their own hyper-dramatic, inaccurate tales. At the same time, various nefarious hoaxes have also proliferated online.\\n\\n“The right information can save lives. The wrong information can cause confusion, mistrust, and can damage the local economy” even without a disaster taking place, says Janine Krippner, a volcanologist at Concord University. Although some may know the difference between objective truth and fake news, Krippner notes that everyone is faced with an increasingly global spread of misinformation “to the point that it affects communities on the other side of the world during a crisis.”\\n\\nWith that in mind, I’ve been scouring the Web over the past 24 hours or so to find the most persistent or most egregious misconceptions relating to the situation in Sulawesi. Let's get debunking, shall we?\\n\\nNope, The Volcanic Eruption and the Tsunami Didn't Happen in the Same Place\\n\\nThis is an understandable misconception. While it’s true that both happened on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, it’s worth pointing out that this is one of the largest islands in the world. This bizarrely shaped landmass is about the same size as Missouri in terms of area. In this sense, the quake, tsunami and Soputan paroxysm are a bit like the eruption that recently took place on the summit and slopes of Hawaii’s Kilauea: it was devastating to human populations nearby, but lava only covered around 0.2% of the entirety of Big Island. Most of it was untouched.\\n\\nOf course, millions have been affected by the tsunami and quake, and some may be affected by the eruption. There will be huge movements of people over the next few weeks and months as recovery efforts continue, and the country's infrastructure and economy will be pushed to the limits. In this sense, plenty are affected. Nevertheless, the tsunami-hit region and the site of the Soputan eruption aren’t near each other at all. Palu, the city that bore the brunt of the tsunami, is in Central Sulawesi, whereas Soputan is found on the top of north Sulawesi, hundreds of kilometres away.\\n\\nThe only way the population affected by the tsunami could be directly impacted by the eruption would be if ash from Soputan were to drift towards them; breathing it in can cause respiratory problems, especially those already in poor health. Additionally, ash could shut down the airport near Soputan. There’s no indication that this may happen yet, but it’s a possibility. This airport is a major hub used for aid relief at the moment, so no-one wants to see it close.\\n\\nNope, That’s Not Footage of Soputan Erupting\\n\\nSo far, the eruption at Soputan isn't proving to be dangerous. No-one lives in the exclusion zone, so the lava flows, pyroclastic flows and ash clouds seem to not be impacting anyone on the ground for the moment.\\n\\nSome outlets, however, seem to want to make it seem far more devastating than it really is. They’ve been using footage of volcanic eruptions from elsewhere, including at the ongoing eruption at the baby volcano at the heart of Krakatau – undoubtedly Indonesia’s most famous volcano – and masquerading it as footage of Soputan.\\n\\nI don't mean using a volcanic cover image of a generic eruption in place of real shots of Soputan, by the way. In that case, if it’s clear that image is not of the current eruption, that’s fine. What I’m referring to here is news reports that are using images of dramatic lava flows (normally from Hawaii’s Kilauea) and pyroclastic flows (normally from Sinabung, another volcano in Indonesia) and pretending that’s what’s happening at Soputan.\\n\\nGiving false impressions of what the eruption is really like can create panic, not only in those on the ground, but in visitors or potential visitors to the country. This can really impact local tourism endeavours, which is particularly devastating for those communities that need that revenue to keep afloat.\\n\\nIf you’re wondering which Soputan eruptions images are real and which are fake, check out Sutopo Purwo Nugroho’s Twitter account. As the spokesperson for the Indonesian disaster agency monitoring the situation, he’s spending an awful lot of time highlighting hoax images and accounts of not just the eruption, but the earthquake and tsunami too.\\n\\nNope, The Ring of Fire Isn’t “Shifting”\\n\\nIt was inevitable that the infamous Ring of Fire was going to come up. I’ve seen plenty of headlines and stories out there in the last few hours that are claiming that scenes in Indonesia, which certainly is on the Ring of Fire, are harbingers of geological doom that's just around the corner.\\n\\nWhenever there’s a series of earthquakes or a particularly resplendent volcanic eruption on this Pacific boundary, you often see stories that make much the same end-of-the-world flavoured claims. It happened most recently when an earthquake sequence took place off the coast of Oregon and California, setting off another cacophony of prophecies that were entirely unfounded.\\n\\nThe Ring of Fire features 90 percent of the world’s earthquakes, and 75 percent of the world’s volcanoes. Quakes and eruptions are exactly what you’d expect here. In fact, if there weren’t any, then that would be incredibly strange.\\n\\nEach quake, and each eruption, is idiosyncratic; no two are alike. They are also, for the most part, not connected in any way: their emergence in time is a random distribution, which means you can’t find interconnected patterns in the chaos. When one fault slips and creates and earthquake, it may upset some faults that are *very close* to it, but this effect diminishes significantly with only a short distance. Quakes will not trigger others like it in different continents. Volcanoes are much the same, but are even less connected; eruptions don't trigger other eruptions at all.\\n\\nAs Ken Hudnut, a California Institute of Technology geophysicist and earthquake expert, told me back in August, tremors are “pretty much randomly distributed.” Scientists are always on the look out for any patterns, but so far they haven’t found any, suggesting any patterns others do find are nothing more than imaginary.\\n\\nThe Ring of Fire is also a bit of a misnomer. Volcanologist Erik Klemetti explains this in more detail here, but the short story is that it has no real geological use. The Pacific Plate boundaries with other tectonic plates around it do form a “ring” shape, but it doesn’t mean that all these boundaries are interconnected.\\n\\nSo no, there’s no Ring of Fire “shift” happening. Indonesia is riddled with faults and volcanoes, so it often features eruptions and earthquakes. This is entirely normal.\\n\\nThe quake in this case got everyone’s attention because it produced a deadly tsunami, but that doesn’t mean another quake will do the same. Similarly, there are dozens of volcanoes around the world erupting at any one time, including many in Indonesia. Soputan is a particularly unpredictable and hazardous volcano that features a human population living nearby in its shadow, which again is why its eruption was cause for concern and attention.\\n\\nNope, Indonesia is Not Getting “Ripped Apart”\\n\\nThis utterly madcap claim appeared in what is unequivocally the most histrionic tabloid around. It seems to be pinned to the fact that three volcanoes are erupting right now in Indonesia. That’s literally it. I can assure you that the country of Indonesia is, in fact, not being physically torn to pieces by any of this geological activity.\\n\\nNope, There’s No Indication Another Huge Quake Is Incoming\\n\\nAs spotted by the Guardian, some have been claiming that a magnitude 8.1 quake is about to hit Central Sulawesi.\\n\\nHere’s the thing about predicting earthquakes: it’s impossible. Seismologists can say roughly where quakes will take place, because they know which parts of the world are seismically active and which are often not. They can also give forecasts which estimate how powerful a future quake may be given a certain time period – normally decades – based on mathematical laws about time, energy and seismicity.\\n\\nWhat they cannot do is say exactly when, where and how powerful a future quake at any one location might be. That’s the seismological Holy Grail, but it’s far from being uncovered. Unlike volcanic eruptions, quakes don’t even give off warning signs before they take place. The best scientists can do is to advise communities on how best to prepare themselves for the next event, which is inevitable, no matter what form of shaking it takes.\\n\\nUnlike plenty of the other rumours, this one looks like it’s being spread mainly by word of mouth. The idea is that, if people panic and leave upon hearing the (fake) news, then thieves can burgle their homes.\"},\n",

He was aided by hundreds of other Filipino militants, as well as fighters from Southeast Asia and the Middle East.\\n\\nHe was killed in October, ending the five-month siege that had left an estimated 1,200 people dead, most of them militants.

       "  'text': 'Last month, I visited Meliana, an Indonesian woman jailed for blasphemy, in a prison in Medan, North Sumatra. The security was tight. No mobile phones. No pens. No money. We could only bring some cakes.\\n\\nI went there with Musdah Mulia, a prominent female Muslim scholar, who challenged the Blasphemy Law (Law 1/PNPS/1965) at Indonesia’s Constitutional Court in 2009-2010, but lost. Mulia gently hugged Meliana, telling her she did nothing wrong and should not be in prison. Meliana sobbed.\\n\\nMeliana shares a cell of about 30 square metres with about 15 women. It’s crowded. There is enough room to sleep but not to move around.\\n\\nMeliana is one of an increasing number of people caught up in the Blasphemy Law in what has historically been considered one of the world’s most tolerant Muslim countries. People who want to keep it that way, including Mulia, need the help of supporters in other countries, including Australia.\\n\\nMeliana’s journey to prison began one Friday in July 2016 when she complained about the volume of the call to prayer from a neighbouring mosque, privately asking the mosque caretaker’s daughter if it could be lowered. Rumours quickly spread that she was demanding that all Muslims stop their calls to prayer in her hometown, Tanjung Balai, about a five-hour drive from Medan.\\n\\nA week later, Muslim mobs attacked her house, and because she’s Buddhist, burned and ransacked at least 14 Buddhist temples. Her two sons fled with their parents.\\n\\n“A pedicab driver, who was Muslim, helped my sons escape,” Meliana said.\\n\\nAfraid of returning to Tanjung Balai, Meliana and her family relocated to Medan. They left their house, their salted-fish business, and their schools. A local militiaman filed a police report against her.\\n\\nPolice apparently tried to slow down the case, hoping that it would go away when tensions eased. But some Muslim groups continued to pressure the police and prosecutors to charge her under the Blasphemy Law. Prosecutors arrested and detained her on 30 May 2018, almost two years after she moved to Medan. On 24 August, the Medan District Court sentenced her to 18 months in prison for blasphemy.\\n\\nThe Blasphemy Law punishes deviations from the central tenets of Indonesia’s six officially recognised religions – Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism – with up to five years in prison. It was only used in eight cases in its first four decades but convictions spiked to 125 during the decade when President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was in power, from 2004 to 2014. Another 23 people have been sentenced since President Joko Widodo took office in 2014.\\n\\nIndonesia’s Constitutional Court rejected three petitions to revoke the Law between 2009 and 2018, declaring that religious freedom was subject to certain limitations to preserve public order. Those limitations, the court stated in its 2010 decision, were to be defined by “religious scholars”.\\n\\nExpand Governor Basuki “Ahok” Purnama after the sentencing in his blasphemy trial in Jakarta on May 9, 2017. © 2017 Reuters\\n\\nThis year, Indonesian courts have convicted six people, including Meliana, on blasphemy charges and sentenced them to between one and five years in prison. They include councillor Riano Jaya Wardhana, over a Facebook comment defending Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Purnama, Wardhana – a Christian who faced a smear campaign, a street vendor, Firdaus, for writing the words “Allah” and “Mohammad” on his sandals, goat herder-cum-spiritualist Arnoldy Bahari, Christian priest Abraham Moses, and student Martinus Gulo.\\n\\nThe highest profile person convicted under the law is undoubtedly former Jakarta Governor Ahok, sentenced to two years in prison in May 2017. Islamist militant groups made his blasphemy prosecution a centrepiece of their ultimately successful efforts to defeat him in the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election.\\n\\nIslamist militant groups have pushed hard for these trials. Blasphemy cases are effective tools to mobilise and agitate Muslims. They seek to expand political power via mass rallies and they promote the use of shari’a, or Islamic law, in Indonesia.\\n\\nThe blasphemy cases against religious minorities, as well as state-sponsored discrimination against women and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, have contributed to the continuing decline in Indonesia’s reputation as a tolerant Muslim country.\\n\\nIn Medan, Lian Tui, Meliana’s husband, told us that the family had lost their salted-fish shop and had to abandon their house in Tanjung Balai. Their oldest son did not continue to university. They have had to use their savings to keep their youngest son in a private school in Medan. Lian Tui visits his wife almost every day, bringing her lunch.\\n\\nMusdah Mulia, who is also a senior member of Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia’s largest Muslim social organisation, is committed to keep fighting against religious discrimination in Indonesia. “We need Islam ramah [friendly], not Islam marah [angry],” she said.\\n\\nBut people like Meliana and Ahok need support from Indonesian authorities and from abroad.\\n\\nThe Indonesian government should promptly revoke the Blasphemy Law and drop the cases against those charged under it. And countries like Australia that espouse religious freedom should keep up the pressure on Indonesia to revoke the law and send their diplomats and political leaders to visit prisoners like Meliana and Ahok.'},\n",

When she tried to intervene in the conversation, furious family members accused her of exploiting the tragedy and she was marched out of the meeting.\\n\\nBut this month she plumbed new depths.\\n\\nIt began with a selfie of her swollen face circulating online, with a claim that she had been assaulted for political reasons. The camp of President Jokowi’s rival in next year’s election, Prabowo Subianto, leapt to her defence.\\n\\nSenior politicians from Prabowo’s Gerindra Party, including lower house deputy speakers, said Ratna had been targeted for her criticism of the president.\\n\\nThe embarrassing episode slid into farce when Prabowo himself chimed in.\\n\\nAfter personally meeting with Ratna, Prabowo denounced the attack and promised that he would complain to the national police chief about this “human rights abuse”.\\n\\nThe only problem is that the “assault” never took place and Ratna was lying about the episode.\\n\\nHer swollen face turned out to be the result of liposuction conducted at a hospital in Jakarta.\\n\\nPoliticians lie all the time, but the Ratna scandal is an abomination simply because it diverted our attention from what mattered most.\\n\\nAirtime and social media should have been devoted to helping the quake victims in Central Sulawesi, but instead we wasted precious energy on finding out if Ratna regularly went under the knife and if she paid for the procedure using money donated to victims of the ferry disaster.\\n\\nBut desperate times bring desperate measures, and politicians do what they must.\\n\\nA quick look at the opinion polls helps shed light on the shameful episode.\\n\\nA reputable Jakarta-based pollster said that the incumbent Jokowi has an unassailable lead of 60.2 per cent over former general Prabowo, who has dropped to 28.7 per cent from 33.2 per cent in May.\\n\\nWorse for Prabowo, almost 63 per cent of voters thought President Jokowi had done a good job in improving the country’s security while another 40 per cent think that the economy is in better shape compared to last year.\\n\\nGiven that dismal outlook, it’s easy to see why Prabowo and his team were quick to seize on Ratna’s claim of assault.\\n\\nThe brouhaha over the liposuction scandal was in fact the biggest story involving Prabowo since the presidential campaign started on September 23.\\n\\nIn fact, the campaigning has been altogether low key, highlighted by mundane news of the visit to traditional Islamic boarding schools by Prabowo and his running mate, businessman and former deputy governor of Jakarta Sandiaga Uno.\\n\\nWhile the pair languish in the shadows, Jokowi has basked in the success of the Asian Games where he managed to paint himself as the youthful leader of a young nation shooting for global success.\\n\\nIndeed, throughout 2018 Jokowi has masterfully engineered a campaign that paints him as the only viable candidate to lead the country for the next five years, until his second term expires in 2024.\\n\\nSo successful has the campaign been that Jokowi is reluctant to make any move that might hurt his record. Witness the government’s flip-flop on raising the price of fuel, a move that would have endangered his popularity.\\n\\nDuring his tenure, Jokowi has gone the extra mile to make sure the price of basic goods is kept relatively low, even if that means paying hefty government subsidies.\\n\\nIt seems he is coasting to a second term, while his rival Prabowo grasps at straws and in doing so shreds his dignity.\\n\\nM Taufiqurrahman is managing editor of the Jakarta Post.\\n\\nThe Asian Writers’ Circle is a series of columns on global affairs written by editors and writers from members of the Asia News Network and published in newspapers, websites and social media platforms across the region.'},\n",

Water!\"), people screamed in horror, pointing to the wall of water barreling towards Palu, just minutes after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the central Sulawesi city on September 28.\\n\\nThe water advanced like a speeding train and roared like thunder. Then waves as high as six metres slammed the coast with a force that ripped out trees, flattened buildings and swept many to their deaths.\\n\\nThat Friday, Satna, 52, and her 31-year-old daughter Herne were at their usual spot by the eastern foot of the city\\'s yellow arched bridge, Ponulele. For a year, they had been selling the chicken and coconut milk delicacy, utatadah, and some beverages from a bamboo stall by the sea. A paragliding event and cultural festival were scheduled that weekend, so heavy foot traffic was expected.\\n\\nMaghrib prayer had just begun and the last ray of the sun was still peeking through the Gawalise mountain range that looms more than 2,000 metres over the city of 350,000 people. The sky was clear and the wind was blowing comfortably. At 27 degrees Celsius, it was perfect for the festivities that night.\\n\\nThen the earth started rocking back and forth.\\n\\nThe violence of the tremor quickly triggered a tsunami. An earthquake-related phenomenon called \"liquefaction\" also followed, turning the ground into rampaging mud that buried whole villages and their residents. \"Banjir lumpur\", a flood of mud, locals referred to it with dread. Pockets of fire around the city were also reported.\\n\\nAs of Monday, at least 1,944 people were reported killed, more than 2,549 injured, and an undetermined number still missing - perhaps as many as 5,000, according to some estimates. A fifth of the city\\'s population has also been displaced.\\n\\n\\'Water! Water!\\'\\n\\nThe fierceness and scale of the disaster had many survivors in disbelief how they cheated death. Some still shuddered at the thought of that fateful day, while wondering how they would recover from their trauma. Others have shown resiliency.\\n\\nWhen they felt the jolt, the first instinct of mother and daughter, Herne and Satna, was to get up and run like the others. Satna injured her right arm after falling three times while running with Herne, as the ground continued to sway underneath them. They said that during the tremor, the soil cracked, and fountains of water started bursting out.\\n\\nIn fear, they rushed towards the bridge, the nearest high ground. But they could not move further. The deck of the bridge had collapsed in the earthquake, its two yellow arches twisted and toppled to one side.\\n\\nSuddenly, they heard people screaming, \"Water! Water!\" When they turned towards the sea, they saw the roaring waves. What they did not know was how high it would be. When a tsunami nears land, it starts to slow down, but it also increases in height as its largest waves crest.\\n\\n\"This must be what Apocalypse looks like,\" Herne thought to herself, recalling the moment to Al Jazeera.\\n\\nWith her left arm, Herne wrapped her mother in an embrace, while locking her right arm as mightily as she could to the bridge railing. Her mother also held on tight to the steel. They were partially protected by the concrete parapet, a low, thick wall along the edge of the bridge.\\n\\nThe torrent of water reached the bridge\\'s abutment, smashing those who sought shelter there, even though it was almost two storeys high. Herne and Satna turned away as the water hit them. At one point, both recalled being underwater, with the current threatening to drag them away.\\n\\n\"I could not tell you how much saltwater I swallowed,\" Satna told Al Jazeera. \"It really felt like it was the end of the world.\"\\n\\nWhen the waves receded, some of the people who fled with Satna and Herne to the bridge were gone. Further down, they saw bodies, some floating in knee-high water. As darkness fell, they fled from the coast, drenched and barefoot.\\n\\nDistricts swallowed\\n\\nAs the tsunami was striking Palu\\'s coast, floods of mud were swallowing up buildings and residents in at least two districts of the city called Balaroa and Petobo. Soil liquefaction takes place when the soil becomes saturated with water, turning it into mud, as a result of intense underground shaking.\\n\\nInside their home in Petobo, high school student Pragati Wira Nur Sabina just finished her ablution, the ceremonial act of washing before Muslim prayers, for sunset worship. She had just arrived from school. Pragati\\'s 17-year-old brother, Muhammad Sultan Prakas, was in the living room.\\n\\nPragati, 15, said shortly after the earthquake, she heard roaring sounds outside. As she and her brother ran out, the walls of their home buckled.\\n\\nShe watched with dread as houses in her neighbourhood tumbled, swept away by the flowing mud.\\n\\n\"It looks like a wave in the ocean,\" Pragati told Al Jazeera, adding she saw other people running away in horror, shouting their plea to God.\\n\\n\"It sounded like thunder when the houses were crashing on top of each other,\" she said. \"I just kept on running because the ground was also moving fast towards me.\"\\n\\n\"I felt like the ground was chasing after me like a mad dog, because it won\\'t stop moving,\" she said, staring blankly as she recalled her ordeal.\\n\\nThe home Pragati\\'s parents built was left in ruins and submerged in the mud.

Lava was visible at the summit during an evening eruption that sent up another ash column. The danger zone around the peak is small and has no residential areas, officials said.\\n\\nA government volcanologist said it\\'s possible the eruption was accelerated by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck on Friday.\\n\\n\"It could be that this earthquake triggered the eruption, but we have seen an increase in volcanic activity since July and this began surging on Monday. Yet we can\\'t say there a direct link, as the mountain is quite far away,\" Kasbani, the head of Indonesia\\'s Volcanology and Geology Disaster Mitigation Agency, said on local television.\\n\\nKasbani, who uses one name, said planes were warned to avoid the area. Volcanic ash is hazardous to plane engines.\\n\\nSoputan\\'s eruption status was raised from an alert to standby 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from the summit and up to 6.5 kilometers to the west-southwest. National disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference in Jakarta that no residential areas are within the 4-kilometer radius.\\n\\nThe volcano agency said the public should avoid the area nearest the volcano and have masks available in the event of ash fall.\\n\\nNazli Ismail, a geophysicist at the University of Syiah Kuala in Banda Aceh on Sumatra island, stressed there was no concrete evidence to show the two incidents are linked.\\n\\n\"People talk about the butterfly effect. The concept is that when a butterfly flaps its wings, it can cause a catastrophe,\" he said. \"So it is possible for the earthquake to trigger the volcano eruption, but it\\'s not conclusive. This needs to be further investigated.\"\\n\\nDanny Hillman Natawidjaja, a geologist with Indonesia\\'s Institute of Science, echoed the views, saying there was not enough data to make a link.\\n\\n\"In principle, the seismic waves from the earthquake could increase pressure in the volcano\\'s magma chamber and could cause an eruption. We don\\'t know for sure,\" he said. He cited the example of the eruption of Mount Talang volcano in Indonesia\\'s Sumatra province in April 2005, which geologists have said was connected to the devastating December 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.\\n\\nIsmail said the Soputan volcano eruption isn\\'t surprising as Indonesia sits on the seismically active Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" and Soputan is one of the most active volcanoes on the island.\\n\\nThe eruption would not affect planes transporting aid and supplies to the quake disaster areas, Nugroho said. The earthquake set off a tsunami and both devastated several communities, causing more than 1,400 deaths and displacing more than 70,000 residents.\\n\\nThe two areas are about 940 kilometers (585 miles) apart, and Nugroho said the volcanic ash was blowing in a different direction from Palu, the largest city in the quake disaster zone. He said it hasn\\'t disrupted plane services or affected any evacuations from the disaster areas.\\n\\nNugroho denounced as hoaxes videos that appeared on social media allegedly showing villagers fleeing billowing volcanic smoke and a smoldering lava river.

According to my mother - I slept through the whole thing - even as our television (they had wheels back then) rolled gently across the room. There were no fatalities.\\n\\nMaritime Southeast Asia (Philippines and Indonesia) is quite different. Situated atop the \"Ring of Fire\", a chain of unstable tectonic plates, these two archipelagic nations are constantly roiled by seismic activity.\\n\\nKarim speaks to 53-year-old Nyoman Gerti and granddaughter Gita after Gunung Merapi’s eruption in November 2017. Ceritalah ASEAN A 120-year-old woman evacuated to Tembuku Bangli camp in Bali. Ceritalah ASEAN Mount Merapi in mid rumble, spewing ashes all around it. Its 2006 and 2010 eruption have wreaked havoc on the island. Joseph Tertia, Ceritalah ASEAN Evacuees staying positive after Mount Agung’s eruption. Ceritalah ASEAN\\n\\nFor Indonesia, \"Alam\" (or Nature) has been a constant presence, if not a threat. Over the past decade and a half, there have been countless tremors, eruptions and tsunamis - so much so that my office administrator in Jakarta chose ground-floor premises because she was too afraid of being stuck in a high-rise building in the event of an earthquake.\\n\\nMy notebooks are full of first-hand accounts, stories of ordinary people battling the elements, coming to terms with loss and then rebuilding life. Each of the experiences is different - there is nothing constant, with the exception of the extreme fear and helplessness felt by the victims at the moment of impact.\\n\\nIndeed ‘Alam’ in Indonesia is highly unpredictable.\\n\\nThere are times when it appears to be playing with mankind, toying with humanity like a cat with a mouse just before it delivers the final coup de grace. For example, back in 2006 as Central Java’s iconic Gunung Merapi threatened to erupt and all eyes were focused on the lava flows and ash being emitted, the tectonic plates suddenly shifted, sending a whiplash-like earthquake through Bantul’s placid communities far to the south. More than 5000 unprepared villagers died from the impact.\\n\\nSimilarly, earlier this year as the Balinese were preparing for the revered volcano, Gunung Agung to erupt, emptying the many villages and farms surrounding the smouldering presence, the Ring of Fire surprised us once again by unleashing its full force on the neighbouring island of Lombok - wreaking havoc on unsuspecting farmers and claiming 564 lives.\\n\\nThe stories are hair-raising and heart-breaking. In Aceh, one interviewee described to me how he was engulfed by a torrent of filthy salt-water (in the 2004 tsunami) and was swept along with garbage, cats, dogs, trees, cars and houses, losing his youngest daughter in the chaos.\\n\\nIn Bantul, after the 6.3 magnitude earthquake in 2006, local farmers described the nausea they felt as the earth itself swayed and shook like the open sea mid-storm. Indeed, I have tried my best to understand what it must be like when the land - something we take for granted as solid and immutable - is transformed into a writhing mass. Having experienced the mildest of tremors, I can only relate the stories of others.\\n\\nOf course, the extreme disruption is matched by the extraordinary fertility of the soil after the earthquakes and eruptions. In the case of Gunung Kelud that erupted four years ago, spewing over 160 million cubic metres of nutrient-rich ash into the skies above East Java and closing down commercial aviation and airports for weeks, harvests in the region have been prodigious. According to my intern, Destya Darmawan whose family farms in nearby Kediri, in the years after the eruption of ash, their pineapple crop doubled and the rice harvest was 50% higher than normal.\\n\\nBut a growing familiarity with natural disasters doesn’t make the loss of life, disability, injury and destruction of property any easier to accept. If anything, it makes you understand all the more keenly the importance of faith and the constancy of religious practice in Indonesia - especially on the Island of Java. With the possibility of death always so close at hand, we need to keep up a constant stream of offerings, prayers and incantations. We can never just give up.\\n\\nNo one can ever be certain that the next outburst from Alam will be like the last.\\n\\nAnd indeed, the earthquake and tsunami in Central Sulawesi has proved once again, Alam’s capacity to surprise and shock in the way whole chunks of Palu were reduced to molten mud that swallowed up communities, homes, churches and mosques like quicksand.\\n\\nEssentially, tectonic activity exerted pressure that loosened the earth’s soil, making it fluid. Previously steady ground turned into a land tsunami, sucking in entire villages in waves. Plots of drier land ended up being carried across the tumult and deposited hundreds of meters from their origin. Liquefaction is Alam’s newest and deadliest trick.\\n\\nIf you live atop the Ring of Fire, you should never falter in your faith because no one can anticipate what will turn up next from Nature\\'s arsenal of tricks. However much we learn, Alam will always reduce us - mere mortals - to supplicants.\\n\\nDisclaimer: The views in this blog are those of the blogger and do not necessarily reflect the views of ABS-CBN Corp.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'The deadly crash of a Lion Air jet in the Java Sea has renewed questions about the safety of Indonesian airlines soon after U.S. and European regulators removed prohibitions against them.\\n\\nA growing middle class and affordable fares have led to a boom in air travel in Asia, putting pressure on airlines, government overseers and infrastructure to keep up.\\n\\nThe surge has been particularly keen at Asia\\'s budget airlines such as Lion Air, whose Flight 610 disappeared into the sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta. The Boeing 737 Max 8 carried 189 people and was bound for Pangkal Pinang on a smaller island in the Indonesian archipelago.\\n\\nData pinged from the plane showed erratic speed, altitude and direction in the minutes after takeoff. Safety experts cautioned, however, that the data must be checked for accuracy against the plane\\'s so-called black boxes, if they are recovered.\\n\\nIndonesia\\'s aviation industry has a checkered past. The United States and the European Union banned its aircraft from their skies in 2007 after a string of accidents.\\n\\nThe Federal Aviation Administration lifted that ban in August 2016. This past June, European regulators — who had already allowed Lion Air and a few other Indonesian carriers to resume flying to Europe — lifted theirs on remaining Indonesia airlines. A spokesman said Monday that the European Commission has no immediate plans to renew the ban on Lion Air, but Australia told government officials and contractors not to fly on the carrier pending findings from the crash investigation.\\n\\nThe bans directly affected few flights, but Europeans were discouraged from flying on Indonesian airlines while visiting the country, where planes are the only practical way to hop among tourist-destination islands including Bali, Java and Sumatra.\\n\\nAmong notable Indonesian accidents:\\n\\n— In 2015, a turboprop operated by Indonesia\\'s Trigana Air crashed in Papua province, killing all 54 people on board. Indonesia\\'s safety agency blamed a number of mistakes by the crew and poor regulatory oversight of the airline.\\n\\n— In 2014, an Indonesia AirAsia jet flying to Singapore crashed into the Java Sea, killing all 162 passengers and crew members. Investigators blamed a rudder-control system that had malfunctioned nearly two dozen times in the previous year, combined with the pilots\\' response.\\n\\n— Miraculously no one was killed in 2013 when a Lion Air jet descended too low, missed the runway and crashed into the sea off Bali, forcing some passengers to swim for their lives. Investigators blamed the crash during poor visibility largely on pilot errors.\\n\\nIn the only previous fatal accident of a Lion Air flight, a plane skidded off a rain-slicked runway and crashed into a cemetery in Surakarta in 2004, killing 25 passengers and crew. The airline has had other problems too, including the arrests of four pilots for drug possession in 2011 and 2012.\\n\\nHarro Ranter, who runs the Aviation Safety Network, said Indonesian airlines must contend with difficult terrain in some provinces, frequent bad weather that leads to poor visibility, and shortcomings with air traffic controllers, who have on occasion put two planes on the same active runway. There have also been fears that the country would be unable to train or attract enough qualified pilots and that airlines would struggle to manage rapid growth, he added.\\n\\n\"Indonesia does stand out ... they did have some really bad accidents in the past,\" Ranter said. \"It\\'s hard to judge if they have made sufficient progress with regard to safety.\"\\n\\nHe said it is difficult to pin a specific accident on the safety culture, but that international regulators will be closely watching the investigation into Flight 610.\\n\\nBoeing and rival Airbus have been stepping up production to meet the seemingly insatiable demand for new planes among global airlines, many of them in Asia.\\n\\nTraffic on the world\\'s airlines — measured in the number of miles or kilometers flown by passengers — jumped 8.1 percent last year, the fastest rate of growth since 2005, according to the International Air Transport Association, a trade group for the industry. It marked the third straight year of traffic growth above the long-term average of 5.5 percent growth in traffic.\\n\\nChina led the way in most new domestic passengers, by a wide margin. Indonesia ranked sixth.\\n\\nAircraft operators in the Asia-Pacific region have had the highest number of accidents in the last five years, accounting for about one-fourth of all accidents, according to the trade group. But the accident rate has declined — from 2.33 every million flights in 2016 to 1.54 every million flights last year.\\n\\nSoutheast Asia and the Pacific have a far lower accident rate than Africa and South America, according to figures from the trade group and the UN\\'s International Civil Aviation Organization.\\n\\nThe Lion Air crash appears to be the first involving the Boeing 737 Max 8, a more fuel-efficient update of Boeing\\'s popular 737, the best-selling airliner ever. Lion Air received the jet involved in the crash just two months ago.\\n\\nIn a statement, Chicago-based Boeing Co. said it was \"deeply saddened\" by the crash and was prepared to offer technical help to investigators.\\n\\nBoeing shares fell on news of the accident. They were down $12.47, or 3.5 percent, at $346.80 in early-afternoon trading.\\n\\nJim Corridore, an analyst for CFRA Research, said Boeing planes have a good safety record and the accident is unlikely to hurt orders for new planes.\\n\\nLion Air became the first airline to get a 737 Max, in May 2017, and has received 13 of the 201 Max planes that Boeing has delivered, according to the Boeing website. Boeing has taken nearly 4,800 orders for the plane, including 201 from Lion Air.\\n\\nSouthwest Airlines was the first U.S. carrier to fly the plane and has taken 23 of them, according to Boeing.\\n\\n___\\n\\nDavid Koenig can be reached at http://twitter.com/airlinewriter'},\n",

He previously said the death toll would be in the “thousands.” However it may prove impossible, in the end, to account for the number of deaths, as hundreds of homes, perhaps thousands, were engulfed in mud and debris in a grisly phenomenon known as liquefaction, when the force of an earthquake turns solid ground into a churning mire.\\n\\n“There are still hundreds of victims buried in mud,” said Sutopo Nugroho, the disaster agency spokesman, speaking on Oct. 2 about the Petobo area of Palu.\\n\\nSurvivors are struggling with a myriad of food and water shortages, power and phone line outages, destroyed homes, trauma, injuries and the slow pace of relief as authorities struggle to navigate damaged, debris-strewn roads.\\n\\nHeavy-lifting equipment was slow to deploy to the region, and by Friday was excavating the ruins of a downed mall in Palu where hundreds of people were thought to have been buried.\\n\\nWahyu Widayanto, CARE’s emergency response coordinator on the ground in Palu, said that accessing money and food is difficult. In an updated posted online by CARE, Mr. Wahyu said “there are currently only 2 banks that have re-opened and just some small food stores which aren’t sufficient for the community here. Gasoline is limited and drinking water is a problem and a real basic need.”\\n\\nDini Widiastuti, Executive Director of Yayasan Plan International Indonesia, a local organisation affiliated with the international NGO Plan International, described a challenging conditions for getting relief items such as tents to survivors, many of who are sleeping outdoors.\\n\\n“Warehousing, storage, channels of transportation, these are all difficult,” she said, speaking by telephone.\\n\\nCompounding delivery of aid is Indonesia’s geography: an archipelago spanning around 3,000 miles that sits on the tectonically active “Ring of Fire.” Palu is almost a thousand miles northeast of capital Jakarta. There are three main avenues for assistance to the affected region, home to around 1.5million people: Balikpapan a city on the Indonesian part of the island of Borneo, or Kalimantan, as well as Makassar, the biggest city Sulawesi, from where it can take a day by road, and via the airport in Palu itself.\\n\\n“It is difficult to move aid around, the airport is operating but limited. We can send more by boat, and it is less expensive, but air is faster,” Ms. Dini said. “From Jakarta, it can take 7 days to Makassar by boat.”\\n\\n“We are in the process of purchasing simple, but life-saving items, like blankets, tarpaulins, water buckets and water purification kits. We will source them locally on the island from our base in Makassar. And we are also looking at creative ways we can bring items by boat to neighboring islands like Kalimantan, and from there, onwards by plane to Palu, said CARE’s Wahyu Widayanto.\\n\\n*contribution to a jointly-authored story with a correspondent in Palu\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter Follow @Arevico'},\n",

But he has warned Indonesia will not tolerate moving the Australian embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Labor will mount its own diplomatic push with Jakarta today by promising closer diplomatic ties and to dump any plan to relocate Australia\\'s Israeli embassy to Jerusalem. The former prime minister was sent to Indonesia by Scott Morrison after Mr Turnbull\\'s ousting in August so upset Jokowi that questions were raised over the relationship and the Australia-Indonesia Free Trade Agreement that is near completion. Senior diplomatic sources said the President, who had a close personal relationship with Mr Turnbull and requested he personally travel to Jakarta, was \"beside himself\" at the ousting of Mr Turnbull.\\n\\nOne source said the President contemplated \"walking away\" from the FTA. Advertisement\\n\\nMr Morrison\\'s subsequent contemplation of relocating Australia\\'s embassy in Israel during the last week of the Wentworth byelection campaign exacerbated the situation, raising fears the FTA which was due to be signed next month could be deferred. \"It\\'s gone down like the proverbial lead balloon in Jakarta,\" said the source. \"[Mr Morrison] can\\'t do it, he\\'ll have to find a way to kill it off.\" It is understood much of the 45-minute meeting between Mr Turnbull and Mr Joko late Monday was about the Jerusalem decision. There were no officials in the room. Mr Turnbull said Jokowi\\'s views about the embassy were \"pretty strong\", but the government could be confident the FTA will be signed next month as scheduled.\\n\\nIndonesia\\'s Foreign Minister Retno Masudi, who complained to her Australian counterpart Marise Payne about the decision, will meet Mr Turnbull on Tuesday. Mr Turnbull noted that his government decided that moving the embassy to Jerusalem \"after careful and considered advice\" was that \"a policy that was well over 40 years old, 50 years old, should remain exactly as it is\". As the government awoke to a new poll on Monday showing it badly lagging Labor and Mr Morrison souring with voters, Labor said Mr Turnbull\\'s trip to Jakarta was a diminution of Mr Morrison\\'s authority. \"I think that Scott Morrison following Donald Trump on foreign policy to try and grab a few extra votes in the Wentworth byelection was short-sighted and irresponsible,\" said deputy Labor leader Tanya Plibersek of the Israel embassy announcement.\\n\\n\"Having to call on Malcolm Turnbull to go and fix the mess that Scott Morrison has made with our neighbours shows that Scott Morrison shouldn\\'t be there in the first place.\" Labor\\'s policy push In a speech to be delivered Tuesday, shadow foreign minister Penny Wong will further Labor\\'s Indo-Pacific policy push by promising, if elected, to establish four new diplomatic posts in the region, one of which will be a consulate in Indonesia. \"Our footprint is still relatively light in Asia. Our embassies and high commissions in the capitals work hard to effect as wide a representation as they can, as do our smaller posts in regional centres,\" she will say. \"But they are limited in the number of staff available and the large distances that need to be covered.\\n\\n\"Given the growing importance of Australia\\'s relationship with Indonesia, a new post there will be a priority.\" In doing so, Senator Wong will slam Mr Morrison\\'s Jerusalem decision as \"an ill disciplined announcement taken without proper consideration and management of consequence or risk\". \"It was a poorly motivated announcement, intended to send a domestic political signal with little regard for foreign policy consequence.\" Senator Wong will also promise to create the positions of geo-economic counsellors to be placed in embassies in Bangkok, Beijing, Hanoi, Jakarta, New Delhi, Tokyo and Washington.\\n\\n\"These geo-economic positions will play a key role in identifying improved ways of connecting and leveraging Australian private sector and civil society activities in the interests of broader foreign policy objectives,\" she will say. \"They will also help to ensure our development, trade and diplomatic policies are integrated and that our development assistance programs across the region are visible to and coordinated with the various Australian enterprises operating there.\" Labor is ramping up its foreign policy credentials ahead of next year\\'s federal election. Last week, shadow treasurer Chris Bowen announced Labor would spend $32 million to boost Asian language teaching in schools and on Monday Labor leader Bill Shorten gave a speech outlining Labor\\'s approach to the region. This included the establishment of a regional investment bank as an alternative to China\\'s Belt-and-Road initiative and a promise of a more nuanced relationship with China and the United States. While the alliance with the US will remain strong, \"we will tell truth to power, recognising that we will not always see eye-to-eye on international issues\" . \"We can, and will, express any differences within the enduring framework of our close relationship,\" he said. \"This is how friends and allies engage. That\\'s what a confident and independent approach to foreign policy means.\" Mr Shorten said unlike the Trump administration, Labor would not always regard China as a regional menace.'},\n",

It is humbling to see the devastation and hear the stories of those who have been affected”, said World Bank Chief Executive Officer, Kristalina Georgieva. “The Government’s immediate relief efforts are robust and impressive. As we enter the reconstruction phase we are making up to $1 billion of comprehensive support available for Indonesia. The best memorial to those who lost their lives is build back better.”\\n\\nThe World Bank package could include cash transfers to the poorest 150,000 affected families for a period between 6 months to one year. This augmentation of existing social protection systems is designed to support the local economy and employment during the recovery phase and to avoid long-term damage to human capital.\\n\\nThe proposed $1 billion package could also include a new standalone emergency recovery program to finance rebuilding of critical public facilities and infrastructure assets: hospitals, schools, bridges, roads, highways, water supply infrastructure. It would also strengthen monitoring and early warning systems, and help to finance the reconstruction of housing settlements and neighborhood level infrastructure and services.\\n\\n\"The government appreciates the attention and support of the international community in our time of need, including from the World Bank Group. Restoring lives and livelihoods of the people affected by natural disasters is the government\\'s utmost priority,\" said Sri Mulyani Indrawati, Finance Minister of Indonesia. \"The World Bank Group has deep and specialist expertise in the area of developing sophisticated financial instruments that can manage risk, and fiscal buffers to prepare for shocks. Indonesia aims to strengthen our resilience towards natural disasters and we look forward to our continued partnership.\"\\n\\nThe World Bank has recently concluded a preliminary damage needs report that assesses the geospatial distribution of the damage, and the estimated cost of the infrastructure, residential and non-residential property that was affected by the Tsunami in Sulawesi. The estimated physical loss is around $531 million (IDR 8.07 trillion), as follows:\\n\\nResidential housing - approximately US$181 million (IDR 2.75 trillion)\\n\\nNon-residential sector - approximately US$185 million (IDR 2.82 trillion)\\n\\nInfrastructure – approximately US$165M (IDR 2.5 trillion).\\n\\nThe preliminary report is the first economic loss estimate based on scientific, economic and engineering analysis. It does not account for loss of life, lost land or the disruption to the economy through lost jobs, livelihoods and business, and is the first input towards supporting the Government of Indonesia’s recovery and reconstruction planning.\\n\\n“Today, as the fourth most populous country in the world - and now a middle-income country - Indonesia has enjoyed strong economic growth and is making significant advancements with poverty eradication efforts”, said World Bank Country Director for Indonesia, Rodrigo A. Chaves. “By working with the government on resilience, disaster recovery and preparedness we aim to help ensure that Indonesia continues its upward economic path.”\\n\\nAbout the World Bank’s partnership with Indonesia\\n\\nThe World Bank’s deep and productive partnership with Indonesia dates back to 1954. Over the past three years, we have committed to 18 projects to covering social assistance, primary health care and nutrition and early childhood development. Our partnership is particularly focused on supporting the development of Indonesia’s human capital and in the implementation of the government’s ambitious National Strategy for Stunting Prevention.\\n\\nFollowing the 2004 Tsunami, the World Bank, along with several global partners, contributed to the recovery and reconstruction efforts in Indonesia by establishing the Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias. This managed around $655 million to rebuild 20,000 earthquake-resistant homes, 3,850 km of roads, 1,600 km of irrigation canals, 677 schools, 500 town halls, 72 clinics, 8,000 wells and clean water sources, as well as more than 1200 sanitation units, among others.\\n\\nAbout the World Bank and Disaster Risk Recovery and Preparedness\\n\\nDisasters hurt the poor and vulnerable the most. Over the past decade, the World Bank has emerged as the global leader in disaster risk management, supporting client countries to assess exposure to hazards and address disaster risks.\\n\\nMainstreaming disaster risk management into development planning can reverse the current trend of rising disaster impact. Furthermore, when countries rebuild stronger, faster and more inclusively after disasters, they can reduce the impact on people’s livelihoods and well-being by as much as 31%, potentially cutting global average losses.\\n\\nIf countries act decisively, they can save lives and assets. However, many developing countries lack the tools, expertise, and instruments to factor the potential impacts of disasters into their investment decisions.'},\n",

Indonesia`s mangrove area is the largest in the world, comprising some 23 percent of the global mangrove area.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile reductions in carbon dioxide emissions are currently at the center of global climate change discussions, the critical role of coastal and marine ecosystems for carbon sequestration or as sinks has been overlooked or even neglected. To this end, Indonesia`s blue carbon ecosystems account for 17 percent of the world`s blue carbon reservoir.\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, Indonesia`s blue carbon ecosystems are among the world`s most threatened. Some three to seven percent of the ecosystems are disappearing every year, with the worst conditions found on the north coast of Java, with the main reasons being dredging, degradation of water quality, deforestation, and aquaculture activities. An estimated 70 percent of Indonesia`s mangrove forests are damaged due to human activities.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a part of a concerted effort to mainstream the coastal and marine sector into the national climate change and conservation policy, the MMAF has been engaged in the Blue Forests Project, which is part of the global coordinated efforts to demonstrate methodologies and approaches for carbon accounting and ecosystem services valuation in coastal and marine ecosystems. Indonesia, through MMAF, remains committed to spending US$400 thousand-$900 thousand in 2019 for the project.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe project represents an opportunity for Indonesia to enhance understanding of ecosystem services, carbon sequestration, storage, avoided emissions, and management in mangrove and seagrass ecosystems through various blue carbon sites in Indonesia. It also supports and enhances the existing national goals on mangrove and seagrass conservation, the National Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation Strategy, and blue carbon related policy assessment.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn addition, Indonesia`s MMAF highly prioritized the conservation of mangrove and seagrass, with the achievement of establishing 20.87 million acres of marine protected area in 2018 and the plan to expand to 30 million acres in 2030.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe MMAF also remains committed to contributing to reduce the degradation of blue carbon ecosystems by enhancing research and programs on sustainable fisheries and aquaculture, including reducing mangrove-to-pond conversion and endorsing silvofishery systems.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe MMAF is currently endorsing the addition of a specific sector on \"Coastal and Marine Sector\" to the draft of Presidential Regulation on Low Carbon Development Planning that has now been reviewed by Indonesia`s National Planning Agency (Bappenas). It is a new platform of development, with the main focus being to sustain social and economic growth through low-carbon activities and minimum exploitation of natural resources.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe inclusion of the \"Coastal and Marine Sector\" into the regulation of Low Carbon Development Planning will guarantee that contribution of the \"Coastal and Marine Sector,\" where blue carbon is a part of it, will be quantified and accounted for, not only from the perspective of climate change but also from the socio-economic benefits to the coastal community.'},\n",

Established by the United Nations in 2011, the day is designed to highlight the accomplishments of girls across the world and promote their empowerment, but also to shine light on the myriad issues and challenges unique to girls. The day uplifts the advancements girls have made in STEM fields, the movements forged by young women, and the young voices speaking up for change, while still acknowledging that we have a long way to go before girls and femmes are afforded the same opportunities, safety, and value that boys are.\\n\\nIn honor of girls everywhere, this is what you need to know about being a girl in the world right now:\\n\\nMore than ever, girls are not straight.\\n\\nAccording to a survey of young people ages 13 to 26 in the U.S. and the U.K., more than half of the respondents said they don\\'t identify as straight. On top of that, a different survey also found that bisexuality is on the rise for young girls.\\n\\nNot all girls have vaginas...\\n\\n...And not all people who have vaginas are girls. This, of course, is nothing new — gender variance existed long before our modern understanding of what it means to identify, or not identify, as a girl. Still, studies have shown that in the U.S., more young people identify as transgender or non-binary than ever, perhaps because of more education, understanding, and openness around what constitutes gender. That\\'s why it\\'s critical that on the Day of the Girl, we include all girls — whether they\\'re cis or transgender.\\n\\nGirls are still missing school because of their periods.\\n\\n\"When basic needs are not met, when something as taboo and private as a period can become available for public scrutiny, girls can’t thrive in school,\" Conscious Period cofounder Annie Lascoe previously told Teen Vogue. Numbers back Lascoe\\'s statement up: UNICEF estimates that 1 in 10 girls across Africa don\\'t attend school while menstruating, while in Britain, more than 137,700 missed school in the past year alone due to their period. Similarly, 28% of girls in India said they don\\'t go to school when they are menstruating. According to the United Nations Girls Education Initiative, one might miss up to 20% of the school year if they are absent because of their period, which could lead to dropping out. Across the world, girls who menstruate are being put at a disadvantage, missing out on education and opportunity, because of a biological inevitability.\\n\\nMany girls are still forced into marriages before age 18.\\n\\nEvery minute, 23 girls under the age of 18 are married. That adds up to 12 million girls every year. According to Girls Not Brides, an organization dedicated to ending child marriage, being married as a child deprives young girls of their access to education, increases their risk of contracting HIV/AIDS, and makes it more likely that they will live in poverty. The organization points out the child brides can be found in every region of the world, including places like the United States, India, Niger, Mexico, Brazil, Greece, Indonesia, and many more.\\n\\nGirls are leading the way more than ever.\\n\\nDespite the risks to girls\\' safety and wellbeing (which are many) across the world, girls are standing up for themselves and leading revolutions — just as they always have. Women and girls of color have often led the charge in social movements, and that\\'s true today as well. Whether girls are leading efforts to end child marriage or period poverty, organizing marches against gun violence, combatting electronic waste, making discoveries that could save thousands of lives, running for office, or any of the other extraordinary things that teens are up to in every part of the globe, girls are leading the way.\\n\\nRelated: New York Times Series Highlights Girlhood Across the Globe on International Day of the Girl\\n\\nLet us slide into your DMs. Sign up for the Teen Vogue daily email.\\n\\nGet the Teen Vogue Take.

They have been microchipped to allow wildlife experts there to continue monitoring them.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe project took two years to hatch and the ACRES team is determined to make it a success.\\n\\n\\n\\n“They have been poached from the wild and smuggled in to meet the demands of the pet trade; many of them actually die. These are more or less the lucky ones who survived this ordeal and I think they truly deserve a second chance to be back in the wild,” said deputy chief executive Anbarasi Boopal.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nShe added that repatriation was in the best interests of the wild animals, as it is “often impossible” to meet all their complex needs in captivity.\\n\\nFor example, the temperature and humidity in Singapore are not suitable for the tortoises, so caregivers would need to provide heat lamps or a dry spot for them to hide.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The humidity in Singapore is actually very high for their needs and it does not suit their requirement. They definitely don’t belong in this space, so they need to go back home,” said Ms Boopal.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Indian star tortoise is protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Yet, it remains one of the most widely trafficked tortoise species in the world due to its striking yellow and black shell, which features a unique star-like radiating pattern.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe star tortoise is prized for its striking yellow and black shell, which features a unique star-like radiating pattern. (Photo: Junn Loh)\\n\\nIn Singapore, the star tortoises are among the five most common types of illegal wildlife seized by the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA), along with hedgehogs, ball pythons, sugar gliders and leopard geckos.\\n\\n\\n\\nAVA investigated an average of 21 cases of illegal CITES and non-CITES live wildlife each year over the past five years. It has dealt with 13 cases up until mid-April this year.\\n\\n\\n\\nREPATRIATION NOT AN EASY PROCESS\\n\\n\\n\\nThe upcoming repatriation of the Indian star tortoises is the country’s most ambitious project to date, to bring home some of the animals that were caught up in the illegal wildlife trade.\\n\\n\\n\\nACRES last sent six reptiles - four giant Asian turtles and two elongated tortoises - back to Malaysia in April. Its first successful reptile repatriation was for a Malaysian giant turtle named Rahayu early last year.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut according to ACRES, the repatriation process is not an easy one.\\n\\n\\n\\nMs Boopal told Channel NewsAsia that it has to first determine if the animals are fit for release into the wild.\\n\\nIt then has to source for a suitable release site, work with partners from the receiving country and apply for permits to transport the animals across borders.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe entire process could take months or years and has often fallen through.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It requires a lot of communication between different countries and different governments. So quite often, rescue centres, zoos, agencies and NGOs that are involved in repatriation need to sit down and discuss how the programme is going to transpire, and the successes around it,” said Dr Jessica Lee, who is senior manager for conservation, research and veterinary services at Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS).\\n\\n\\n\\nShe added that countries may also hesitate to take the animal back if the species is not considered a conservation priority.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is also the risk of disease transmission for all animals – whether they were smuggled in or not.\\n\\nCiting the example of the Javan mynah, which is commonly found in Singapore, Dr Lee said: “If we don’t know the disease status of animals in the country where they are introduced, and the original country, we cannot move birds easily and simply.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The last thing we want to do is to move birds that are carrying a disease into Indonesia, or any country, that will introduce the disease into native populations in the country of origin. That may have (a) negative impact on those populations.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThis ploughshare tortoise, which was smuggled into Singapore, is now part of the zoo’s collection and educational campaign efforts. (Photo: Junn Loh)\\n\\nBut the biggest hurdle to overcome is financing.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Funding is pretty much one of the reasons repatriation is not the first option,\" Dr Lee said. \"Quite often, many countries may not have the expertise, the time or the financial resources to carry out the programme.”\\n\\n\\n\\nACRES\\' upcoming project, for example, will set it back by S$60,000 – an amount it is still trying to raise.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo what happens if repatriation is not an option?\\n\\n\\n\\nMany of these animals could end up living out their lives at ACRES or WRS, which is the designated centre for rescued wildlife in Singapore.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We will try our best to absorb the animal in question into our collection and give them the best standard of care possible, with the hopes that we can put them back in the wild in the future,” said Dr Lee.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe animal could also form part of the Singapore Zoo’s breeding programme, or become the face of its educational campaign to raise awareness of the illegal wildlife trade.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe rescue facilities are concerned that illegal online trade could feed a growing appetite for exotic animals. Already, ACRES is seeing an increase in the number of online advertisements selling illegal wildlife.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis could put the animals under threat, more than ever.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Phillip Coorey by Malcolm Turnbull has reset relations with Indonesia and expressed confidence the Free Trade Agreement will be signed next month after meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo. But he has warned Indonesia will not tolerate moving the Australian embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Labor will mount its own diplomatic push with Jakarta today by promising closer diplomatic ties and to dump any plan to relocate Australia\\'s Israeli embassy to Jerusalem. The former prime minister was sent to Indonesia by Scott Morrison after Mr Turnbull\\'s ousting in August so upset Jokowi that questions were raised over the relationship and the Australia-Indonesia Free Trade Agreement that is near completion. Senior diplomatic sources said the President, who had a close personal relationship with Mr Turnbull and requested he personally travel to Jakarta, was \"beside himself\" at the ousting of Mr Turnbull.\\n\\nOne source said the President contemplated \"walking away\" from the FTA. Advertisement\\n\\nMr Morrison\\'s subsequent contemplation of relocating Australia\\'s embassy in Israel during the last week of the Wentworth byelection campaign exacerbated the situation, raising fears the FTA which was due to be signed next month could be deferred. \"It\\'s gone down like the proverbial lead balloon in Jakarta,\" said the source. \"[Mr Morrison] can\\'t do it, he\\'ll have to find a way to kill it off.\" It is understood much of the 45-minute meeting between Mr Turnbull and Mr Joko late Monday was about the Jerusalem decision. There were no officials in the room. Mr Turnbull said Jokowi\\'s views about the embassy were \"pretty strong\", but the government could be confident the FTA will be signed next month as scheduled.\\n\\nIndonesia\\'s Foreign Minister Retno Masudi, who complained to her Australian counterpart Marise Payne about the decision, will meet Mr Turnbull on Tuesday. Mr Turnbull noted that his government decided that moving the embassy to Jerusalem \"after careful and considered advice\" was that \"a policy that was well over 40 years old, 50 years old, should remain exactly as it is\". As the government awoke to a new poll on Monday showing it badly lagging Labor and Mr Morrison souring with voters, Labor said Mr Turnbull\\'s trip to Jakarta was a diminution of Mr Morrison\\'s authority. \"I think that Scott Morrison following Donald Trump on foreign policy to try and grab a few extra votes in the Wentworth byelection was short-sighted and irresponsible,\" said deputy Labor leader Tanya Plibersek of the Israel embassy announcement.\\n\\n\"Having to call on Malcolm Turnbull to go and fix the mess that Scott Morrison has made with our neighbours shows that Scott Morrison shouldn\\'t be there in the first place.\" Labor\\'s policy push In a speech to be delivered Tuesday, shadow foreign minister Penny Wong will further Labor\\'s Indo-Pacific policy push by promising, if elected, to establish four new diplomatic posts in the region, one of which will be a consulate in Indonesia. \"Our footprint is still relatively light in Asia. Our embassies and high commissions in the capitals work hard to effect as wide a representation as they can, as do our smaller posts in regional centres,\" she will say. \"But they are limited in the number of staff available and the large distances that need to be covered.\\n\\n\"Given the growing importance of Australia\\'s relationship with Indonesia, a new post there will be a priority.\" In doing so, Senator Wong will slam Mr Morrison\\'s Jerusalem decision as \"an ill disciplined announcement taken without proper consideration and management of consequence or risk\". \"It was a poorly motivated announcement, intended to send a domestic political signal with little regard for foreign policy consequence.\" Senator Wong will also promise to create the positions of geo-economic counsellors to be placed in embassies in Bangkok, Beijing, Hanoi, Jakarta, New Delhi, Tokyo and Washington.\\n\\n\"These geo-economic positions will play a key role in identifying improved ways of connecting and leveraging Australian private sector and civil society activities in the interests of broader foreign policy objectives,\" she will say. \"They will also help to ensure our development, trade and diplomatic policies are integrated and that our development assistance programs across the region are visible to and coordinated with the various Australian enterprises operating there.\" Labor is ramping up its foreign policy credentials ahead of next year\\'s federal election. Last week, shadow treasurer Chris Bowen announced Labor would spend $32 million to boost Asian language teaching in schools and on Monday Labor leader Bill Shorten gave a speech outlining Labor\\'s approach to the region. This included the establishment of a regional investment bank as an alternative to China\\'s Belt-and-Road initiative and a promise of a more nuanced relationship with China and the United States. While the alliance with the US will remain strong, \"we will tell truth to power, recognising that we will not always see eye-to-eye on international issues\" . \"We can, and will, express any differences within the enduring framework of our close relationship,\" he said. \"This is how friends and allies engage. That\\'s what a confident and independent approach to foreign policy means.\" Mr Shorten said unlike the Trump administration, Labor would not always regard China as a regional menace.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Ahmadi Muslims from around the United States and Canada welcomed the spiritual leader of their faith to their Baltimore County mosque Saturday — an occasion as inspirational to them as a papal visit to Catholics.\\n\\nHazrat Mirza Masroor Ahmad, the fifth Khalifa of Islam, came to Rosedale to inaugurate the Bait-us-Samad mosque as part of a U.S. tour that earlier brought him to the Islamic denomination’s national headquarters in Silver Spring.\\n\\nLike the pope, the khalifa (caliph) is known to his tens of millions of followers in more than 200 countries as His Holiness. And to many of roughly 1,000 Ahmadi Muslims who waited for hours in the mosque’s parking lot to await the 68-year-old cleric’s visit, it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.\\n\\n“When the spiritual father is here, it’s like heaven on earth,” said Nasim Rehmatullah, national vice president of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community.\\n\\n“He’s like a father to all of us,” said Abdullah Dibba, imam of the mosque. “If you write to him, he responds.”\\n\\nDibba said Ahmadi Muslims feel especially devoted to the fifth khalifa because he uses technology to remain a weekly presence in their lives. He said the khalifa’s sermons are televised through the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community’s worldwide television channel every Friday.\\n\\nAhmadiyya is one of the smaller branches of Islam, one that many mainstream Sunni and Shia Muslims regard as not Islamic at all.\\n\\nIt was founded in India in 1889 by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. Ahmadiyya Muslims differ from other worshipers of Allah in that they believe the messiah has already come to earth in the person of their founder, whom they regard as a reformer calling Muslims back to the original teachings of the Prophet Muhammad.\\n\\nMany American Ahmadis sport pins with the slogan “Love for All, Hatred for None,” an expression of the sect’s devotion to nonviolence except for military service to one’s country.\\n\\n“We are absolutely against all forms of violence, terrorism, extremism,” Dibba said. “We don’t label anyone as our enemy.”\\n\\nAhmadiyya may not label anyone as enemies, but there are many Muslims who don’t like them. Pakistan has adopted a law forbidding its Ahmadi minority from identifying themselves as Muslims. Ahmadis have been murdered in riots there and in Indonesia. Saudi Arabia won’t allow them in that country. The sect moved its work headquarters to London, to escape persecution in Pakistan.\\n\\nYet Ahmadis believe in emphasizing the positive — especially about life in the United States.\\n\\n“You can ask any of our neighbors. We do not feel oppressed in America,” Dibba said.\\n\\nThe Ahmadis, who have had a Baltimore chapter since 1960, opened their Rosedale mosque two years ago in a former church, Dibba said. It has been open for prayer and community activities, but Saturday was opportunity for the khalifa to officially inaugurate it. Rehmatullah said the Ahmadis have 74 chapters in the United States but that Baltimore’s is one of 10-15 with its own mosque.\\n\\nThe khalifa is elected in a process not unlike the selection of a Catholic pope, and Ahmadis believe the scholars who choose him are merely doing God’s will. Ahmad has held that position since the death of the fourth khalifa in 2003.\\n\\nThe white-bearded cleric arrived Saturday as part of a motorcade from Philadelphia about 2:30 p.m. wearing a white and gold turban. He walked briskly along a red carpet to the front of the building as children called out the words of poems they had been practicing for months.\\n\\nOnce there, with a prayer but no public speech, he removed the drapes covering the plaque inaugurating the mosque “in the name of Allah, the gracious, the merciful.”\\n\\nHe then went inside to inspect the mosque and lead afternoon prayers in a room filled with more than 200 men of the Ahmadiyya community. He knelt and bowed and intoned “Allahu akbar” (God is great) in the mihrab, the niche facing Mecca found in every mosque.\\n\\nAfter prayer with the men, the khalifa went upstairs to visit the women in their separate praying area.\\n\\nNusrat Qadir Chaudhry, a neonatal intensive care nurse who had come from northern New Jersey for the khalifa’s visit, said that “people were literally in tears” when he visited the women. She said that when one little girl approached him, he put his hand on her head while she hugged him.\\n\\n“All the women were really pleased,” Chaudhry said.\\n\\nChaudhry that with some male Muslims from other denominations, “you sense the patriarchy.” But she said the khalifa is “very encouraging of women’s advancement.”\\n\\nBefore departing for a reception downtown with a high-powered group of political, business and religious leaders, Ahmad paused to plant a red maple tree in a corner of the mosque’s grounds.\\n\\n“Now that I’ve planted it, don’t forget about it,” he told his local followers.\\n\\nmdresser@baltsun.com\\n\\ntwitter.com/michaeltdresser'},\n",

It does not account for loss of life, lost land or the disruption to the economy through lost jobs, livelihoods and business, and is the first input towards supporting the Government of Indonesia’s recovery and reconstruction planning.\\n\\n“Today, as the fourth most populous country in the world - and now a middle-income country - Indonesia has enjoyed strong economic growth and is making significant advancements with poverty eradication efforts”, said World Bank Country Director for Indonesia, Rodrigo A. Chaves. “By working with the government on resilience, disaster recovery and preparedness we aim to help ensure that Indonesia continues its upward economic path.”\\n\\nAbout the World Bank’s partnership with Indonesia\\n\\nThe World Bank’s deep and productive partnership with Indonesia dates back to 1954. Over the past three years, we have committed to 18 projects to covering social assistance, primary health care and nutrition and early childhood development. Our partnership is particularly focused on supporting the development of Indonesia’s human capital and in the implementation of the government’s ambitious National Strategy for Stunting Prevention.\\n\\nFollowing the 2004 Tsunami, the World Bank, along with several global partners, contributed to the recovery and reconstruction efforts in Indonesia by establishing the Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias. This managed around $655 million to rebuild 20,000 earthquake-resistant homes, 3,850 km of roads, 1,600 km of irrigation canals, 677 schools, 500 town halls, 72 clinics, 8,000 wells and clean water sources, as well as more than 1200 sanitation units, among others.\\n\\nAbout the World Bank and Disaster Risk Recovery and Preparedness\\n\\nDisasters hurt the poor and vulnerable the most. Over the past decade, the World Bank has emerged as the global leader in disaster risk management, supporting client countries to assess exposure to hazards and address disaster risks.\\n\\nMainstreaming disaster risk management into development planning can reverse the current trend of rising disaster impact. Furthermore, when countries rebuild stronger, faster and more inclusively after disasters, they can reduce the impact on people’s livelihoods and well-being by as much as 31%, potentially cutting global average losses.\\n\\nIf countries act decisively, they can save lives and assets. However, many developing countries lack the tools, expertise, and instruments to factor the potential impacts of disasters into their investment decisions.'},\n",

But he has warned Indonesia will not tolerate moving the Australian embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Labor will mount its own diplomatic push with Jakarta today by promising closer diplomatic ties and to dump any plan to relocate Australia\\'s Israeli embassy to Jerusalem. The former prime minister was sent to Indonesia by Scott Morrison after Mr Turnbull\\'s ousting in August so upset Jokowi that questions were raised over the relationship and the Australia-Indonesia Free Trade Agreement that is near completion. Senior diplomatic sources said the President, who had a close personal relationship with Mr Turnbull and requested he personally travel to Jakarta, was \"beside himself\" at the ousting of Mr Turnbull.\\n\\nOne source said the President contemplated \"walking away\" from the FTA. Advertisement\\n\\nMr Morrison\\'s subsequent contemplation of relocating Australia\\'s embassy in Israel during the last week of the Wentworth byelection campaign exacerbated the situation, raising fears the FTA which was due to be signed next month could be deferred. \"It\\'s gone down like the proverbial lead balloon in Jakarta,\" said the source. \"[Mr Morrison] can\\'t do it, he\\'ll have to find a way to kill it off.\" It is understood much of the 45-minute meeting between Mr Turnbull and Mr Joko late Monday was about the Jerusalem decision. There were no officials in the room. Mr Turnbull said Jokowi\\'s views about the embassy were \"pretty strong\", but the government could be confident the FTA will be signed next month as scheduled.\\n\\nIndonesia\\'s Foreign Minister Retno Masudi, who complained to her Australian counterpart Marise Payne about the decision, will meet Mr Turnbull on Tuesday. Mr Turnbull noted that his government decided that moving the embassy to Jerusalem \"after careful and considered advice\" was that \"a policy that was well over 40 years old, 50 years old, should remain exactly as it is\". As the government awoke to a new poll on Monday showing it badly lagging Labor and Mr Morrison souring with voters, Labor said Mr Turnbull\\'s trip to Jakarta was a diminution of Mr Morrison\\'s authority. \"I think that Scott Morrison following Donald Trump on foreign policy to try and grab a few extra votes in the Wentworth byelection was short-sighted and irresponsible,\" said deputy Labor leader Tanya Plibersek of the Israel embassy announcement.\\n\\n\"Having to call on Malcolm Turnbull to go and fix the mess that Scott Morrison has made with our neighbours shows that Scott Morrison shouldn\\'t be there in the first place.\" Labor\\'s policy push In a speech to be delivered Tuesday, shadow foreign minister Penny Wong will further Labor\\'s Indo-Pacific policy push by promising, if elected, to establish four new diplomatic posts in the region, one of which will be a consulate in Indonesia. \"Our footprint is still relatively light in Asia. Our embassies and high commissions in the capitals work hard to effect as wide a representation as they can, as do our smaller posts in regional centres,\" she will say. \"But they are limited in the number of staff available and the large distances that need to be covered.\\n\\n\"Given the growing importance of Australia\\'s relationship with Indonesia, a new post there will be a priority.\" In doing so, Senator Wong will slam Mr Morrison\\'s Jerusalem decision as \"an ill disciplined announcement taken without proper consideration and management of consequence or risk\". \"It was a poorly motivated announcement, intended to send a domestic political signal with little regard for foreign policy consequence.\" Senator Wong will also promise to create the positions of geo-economic counsellors to be placed in embassies in Bangkok, Beijing, Hanoi, Jakarta, New Delhi, Tokyo and Washington.\\n\\n\"These geo-economic positions will play a key role in identifying improved ways of connecting and leveraging Australian private sector and civil society activities in the interests of broader foreign policy objectives,\" she will say. \"They will also help to ensure our development, trade and diplomatic policies are integrated and that our development assistance programs across the region are visible to and coordinated with the various Australian enterprises operating there.\" Labor is ramping up its foreign policy credentials ahead of next year\\'s federal election. Last week, shadow treasurer Chris Bowen announced Labor would spend $32 million to boost Asian language teaching in schools and on Monday Labor leader Bill Shorten gave a speech outlining Labor\\'s approach to the region.

It would be guided by a US$5 million grant for technical assistance for detailed planning to ensure reconstruction is resilient and community-led.\\n\\n“On Friday I visited the city of Palu in Sulawesi with His Excellency Vice President Kalla. It is humbling to see the devastation and hear the stories of those who have been affected”, said World Bank Chief Executive Officer, Kristalina Georgieva. “The Government’s immediate relief efforts are robust and impressive. As we enter the reconstruction phase we are making up to $1 billion of comprehensive support available for Indonesia. The best memorial to those who lost their lives is build back better.”\\n\\nThe World Bank package could include cash transfers to the poorest 150,000 affected families for a period between 6 months to one year. This augmentation of existing social protection systems is designed to support the local economy and employment during the recovery phase and to avoid long-term damage to human capital.\\n\\nThe proposed $1 billion package could also include a new standalone emergency recovery program to finance rebuilding of critical public facilities and infrastructure assets: hospitals, schools, bridges, roads, highways, water supply infrastructure. It would also strengthen monitoring and early warning systems, and help to finance the reconstruction of housing settlements and neighborhood level infrastructure and services.\\n\\n\"The government appreciates the attention and support of the international community in our time of need, including from the World Bank Group. Restoring lives and livelihoods of the people affected by natural disasters is the government\\'s utmost priority,\" said Sri Mulyani Indrawati, Finance Minister of Indonesia. \"The World Bank Group has deep and specialist expertise in the area of developing sophisticated financial instruments that can manage risk, and fiscal buffers to prepare for shocks. Indonesia aims to strengthen our resilience towards natural disasters and we look forward to our continued partnership.\"\\n\\nThe World Bank has recently concluded a preliminary damage needs report that assesses the geospatial distribution of the damage, and the estimated cost of the infrastructure, residential and non-residential property that was affected by the Tsunami in Sulawesi. The estimated physical loss is around $531 million (IDR 8.07 trillion), as follows:\\n\\nResidential housing - approximately US$181 million (IDR 2.75 trillion)\\n\\nNon-residential sector - approximately US$185 million (IDR 2.82 trillion)\\n\\nInfrastructure – approximately US$165M (IDR 2.5 trillion).\\n\\nThe preliminary report is the first economic loss estimate based on scientific, economic and engineering analysis. It does not account for loss of life, lost land or the disruption to the economy through lost jobs, livelihoods and business, and is the first input towards supporting the Government of Indonesia’s recovery and reconstruction planning.\\n\\n“Today, as the fourth most populous country in the world - and now a middle-income country - Indonesia has enjoyed strong economic growth and is making significant advancements with poverty eradication efforts”, said World Bank Country Director for Indonesia, Rodrigo A. Chaves. “By working with the government on resilience, disaster recovery and preparedness we aim to help ensure that Indonesia continues its upward economic path.”\\n\\nAbout the World Bank’s partnership with Indonesia\\n\\nThe World Bank’s deep and productive partnership with Indonesia dates back to 1954. Over the past three years, we have committed to 18 projects to covering social assistance, primary health care and nutrition and early childhood development. Our partnership is particularly focused on supporting the development of Indonesia’s human capital and in the implementation of the government’s ambitious National Strategy for Stunting Prevention.\\n\\nFollowing the 2004 Tsunami, the World Bank, along with several global partners, contributed to the recovery and reconstruction efforts in Indonesia by establishing the Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias. This managed around $655 million to rebuild 20,000 earthquake-resistant homes, 3,850 km of roads, 1,600 km of irrigation canals, 677 schools, 500 town halls, 72 clinics, 8,000 wells and clean water sources, as well as more than 1200 sanitation units, among others.\\n\\nAbout the World Bank and Disaster Risk Recovery and Preparedness\\n\\nDisasters hurt the poor and vulnerable the most. Over the past decade, the World Bank has emerged as the global leader in disaster risk management, supporting client countries to assess exposure to hazards and address disaster risks.\\n\\nMainstreaming disaster risk management into development planning can reverse the current trend of rising disaster impact. Furthermore, when countries rebuild stronger, faster and more inclusively after disasters, they can reduce the impact on people’s livelihoods and well-being by as much as 31%, potentially cutting global average losses.\\n\\nIf countries act decisively, they can save lives and assets. However, many developing countries lack the tools, expertise, and instruments to factor the potential impacts of disasters into their investment decisions.'},\n",

Bank transactions are increasingly moving away from physical branches.\\n\\nSINGAPORE -- Just a few years ago, starting a retail banking operation in Indonesia, a nation teeming with islands stretched across a distance as wide as the U.S., would require investing in thousands of physical branches and on an army of bank tellers.\\n\\nBut Singapore\\'s largest banking group DBS Group Holdings is attempting to disrupt that business expansion model by wielding its own branchless smartphone banking platform.\\n\\nThe bank launched digibank in Indonesia in August last year, the biggest selling point being accounts that can be opened without visiting a bank branch. Although other banks offer similar digital services, almost all of them require customers to open accounts at physical locations.\\n\\nDBS sales associates can be found in over 50 coffee shops and malls in the cities of Jakarta, Bandung, Surabaya and Jogjakarta. Signing up takes about 15 to 30 minutes -- or \"as long as it takes to drink a coffee,\" as the digibank salesforce promotes. The accounts check fingerprints through e-KTP, the Indonesian electronic identification card.\\n\\nNew applicants can verify their biometric identities on the spot at coffee shops, or they can wait at home for digibank agents to come visit them. Through their mobile phones, customers can accept deposits, transfer funds, and an artificial intelligence program answers most basic queries, such as those regarding balances and account histories.\\n\\nAfter DBS rolled out digibank in India in 2016, it captured over 2 million customers, yet only 60 to 70 people run that operation. \"In the last five years since 2013, the whole world has changed,\" said Pearlyn Phau, deputy group head of the consumer banking group and wealth management at DBS.\\n\\nA DBS representative promotes digibank at a shopping mall in Jakarta. The bank launched the service in Indonesia last year.\\n\\nThe fact that smartphones handle almost all aspects of life, especially among the younger demographic, have paved the way for this moment. Advances in financial technology and flexible government regulations were also tail winds. \"With the digital model, what we\\'re trying to do is to re-enter the retail space, but without the high cost of brick-and-mortar,\" said Phau.\\n\\nDBS plans to add lending functions to digibank by the end of this year. In Indonesia, digibank drew about 600,000 users over the past year. \"In the next five years, we want to book around 3.5 million customers,\" said Wawan Salum, managing director of the consumer banking group at PT Bank DBS Indonesia.\\n\\nAnother Indonesian bank, Bank BTPN, is attempting to eliminate the face-to-face verification step altogether. The company is applying for government permission to verify new accounts for Jenius, the smartphone-based financial service platform, via video calls.\\n\\n\"Once that is approved, we will not even send someone on a motorbike to come and visit you for identification,\" said Peterjan van Nieuwenhuizen, BTPN\\'s head of digital banking. \"You can just do a video call on your phone.\"\\n\\nJenius, which went live in 2016, began offering unsecured loans last month. Lending limits are set based on an individual\\'s financial profile, such as the transaction history, and the financing includes instant-access credit lines. Jenius could offer insurance and wealth management products later on.\\n\\n\"We started consumer retail banking...from scratch,\" said Nieuwenhuizen. \"We started from the concept of how we can be a life finance tool rather than a bank. Traditionally, it would have been very difficult for us, or any new player, to enter [Indonesia] because you\\'re building a thousand branches across more than 13,000 islands.\"\\n\\nJakarta, Indonesia\\'s capital, suffers from traffic snarls like other major metropolises across Southeast Asia. The extra effort to travel to a bank branch has contributed to the lack of foot traffic to bank branches. But the spread of smartphones has granted youth tools to easily fulfill bank transactions. Only 20% of adult Indonesians held accounts in 2011, but the share has risen to 49% last year, World Bank data shows.\\n\\nGlobally, about 1.7 billion adults have neither opened an account, nor transferred money with a mobile phone, the World Bank estimates. However, two-thirds of unbanked adults have mobile phones. That shows digital banking could be ripe for explosion in places like the Philippines and Vietnam.\\n\\nInnovative financial services open the door for small to mid-tier banks, as well as foreign players, to expand market shares -- more so than large, established banks. Go-Jek, the Indonesian ride-hailing app, also poses a threat to traditional banks since it runs an online payment service.'},\n",

It aims to help with fish species identification by staff from fisheries agencies tasked with collecting catch data in fish markets and landing places in Indonesia.\\n\\nIndonesia is one of the largest maritime nations and fish producers in the world. The marine catch for Indonesia is over 6.2 million tonnes based on 2015 statistics.\\n\\nIt is fundamental to accurately identify fish species that have been captured.

It employs more than 12.3 million people, according to a 2016 report.\\n\\nImproving the ability of fisheries staff to accurately identify fish species in markets is a high priority for regional fisheries management organisations such as the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission.\\n\\nFisheries staff who collect fish catch data are primarily officers of the Marine and Fisheries Agency at the provincial, regency, municipal and district levels, and officers of port authorities. Data collection staff are also employed in various non-governmental organisation programs operating in Indonesia. Data on catches are collected from most landing sites and fishing ports daily, or at least several times per week.\\n\\nIf identifications made by fisheries staff are correct, the stock assessments will be more accurate. If monitored and enforced, this can help move towards sustainable fisheries.\\n\\nConversely, if the catch data collected by fisheries staff include incorrect species information, the stock assessments generated could suggest that less or more fish are being caught than is actually the case. This could result in the fishery being underutilised or overexploited.\\n\\nChallenges on the ground\\n\\nFisheries staff have been equipped with identification field guides. But these guides all portray fish in their freshest condition, with live colours and markings usually visible. This does not represent how fish typically appear in the market.\\n\\nFishery data collection in Indonesian markets and landing sites encounters a number of challenges:\\n\\nsheer number of species – Indonesia is located in the megadiverse Coral Triangle and at least 1,000 species of fish have been documented from Indonesian markets, with many more yet to be discovered\\n\\nfish are present at most life stages – juveniles can look very different from their adults, with juveniles of some species very difficult to distinguish from their closest relatives\\n\\nlimited timing – fisheries staff often have a narrow window of time to identify fish as they can move quickly through the marketplace\\n\\ncatch condition – fish regularly appear in poor condition in fish markets, which can be due to long periods at sea with limited ice or being in the market for an extended period\\n\\ndamaged or incomplete fish – fish may have had key features removed, such as the bills of billfish or fins of sharks, or whole parts missing, e.g. heads.\\n\\nHow to use fishIDER\\n\\nfishIDER consists of four main sections: species profile pages, interactive learning, image galleries of fish in market condition, and an interactive glossary.\\n\\nSpecies pages include interactive keys for identifying fish to species level, and information on their ecology, distribution and importance to local fisheries.\\n\\nThe interactive learning sections consist of games and quizzes to help improve users’ fish identification skills.\\n\\nThe illustrated glossary is an important resource for users to improve their understanding of taxonomic terms.\\n\\nIncluded in this first stage of fishIDER are about 60 pelagic species, including the tunas and mackerels, billfish and sharks. These species are among the most important food fish species groups in Indonesia and the accuracy of identification for these species needs urgent improvement.\\n\\nThis collaborative project not only helps Indonesia achieve a stronger capability in fisheries monitoring, but also benefits Australia’s fisheries management. Many fish resources have wide ranges across multiple countries. Therefore improvements to management of fish stocks in the region will help improve food security into the future.\\n\\nAs an example, the highly migratory Southern Bluefin Tuna migrates from southern Australian waters to the tropical waters of southern Indonesia to spawn. Both Indonesian and Australian fisheries utilise Southern Bluefin Tuna stocks and work with the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna to ensure the sustainability of this fishery. So, for the effective management of Southern Bluefin Tuna it’s crucial that Indonesian fisheries staff are accurately identifying this species in their catches.\\n\\nThis is just one example of the potential of fishIDER as a tool in building capacity to improve fisheries management. We are seeking new partnerships to expand fishIDER to the broader Southeast Asia and Pacific Island region to help improve fisheries management on a larger scale.\\n\\nHelen O’Neill, web content analyst, CSIRO; Craig Proctor, Fisheries Scientist, CSIRO, and William White, Senior Curator of Australian National Fish Collection, CSIRO\\n\\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

A place for dreams. A place that expresses the desire to leave the next generation with a better and brighter future,” Peres said in the message.\\n\\n“The future is made of the dreams of today, we must continue to work on developing the vision of tomorrow, not simply on remembering the past. We have the power to create change and the opportunity to have an impact. A revolution against convention is necessary. It requires daring, dissatisfaction, and healthy and vibrant chutzpah.”\\n\\nPeres emphasized that “we must caution ourselves, [because]technology without values will endanger humanity, while values without technology will bring about hunger and stagnation.\\n\\n“The Israeli Innovation Center will tell the extraordinary and inspiring story of the State of Israel as the innovation nation,” he continued. “A home for optimism and hope. A place for cooperation and coexistence between all sectors of Israeli society, and a link between Israel and the world.”\\n\\nHe added that the purpose of this place is to spread ideas “near and far to bring peace and prosperity closer, to make a positive change both in spirit and in reality for us and for our neighbors, and for humanity as a whole,” concluding in Hebrew, “and I remind you that a person with no fantasy will not make fantastic things.”\\n\\nThe four-floor innovation center was one of President Shimon Peres’ dreams. He personally laid the cornerstone in July 2016 together with Netanyahu and President Reuven Rivlin only three months before passing away.\\n\\nIn an emotional speech after the hologram disappeared, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stressed the importance of innovation to normalize relations with neighboring countries.\\n\\n“I remember the conversations I had with Shimon,” Netanyahu said, “when he spoke about innovation and peace, Shimon ’s eyes showed, sparkled. He had a tremendous confidence in the youth of Israel, and the genius of Israel. Here’s where we saw completely eye-to-eye.\\n\\n“It is called the grand opening for innovation and peace center because the idea is that peace and innovation absolutely go together, innovation is an engine of peace, not only of progress,” the prime minister explained.\\n\\n“ Neighbouring countries now reach [out to]Israel [to]normalize relations because of innovation,” said Netanyahu, “not merely for security reasons but for civilian reasons. They see Israel as a hub of innovation that can offer a better richer and longer life for their people.”\\n\\nFounded in 1996 by Shimon Peres, the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation is now chaired by the late president’s son Chemi Peres.\\n\\nThe center’s website explains that “the focus is a prosperous Israel, nurturing and highlighting Israeli innovation, and paving the way for shared-living between all of Israel’s citizens and lasting peace between Israel and its neighbors.”\\n\\nSpeaking at the ceremony, Chemi said his father always said “that innovation should be used to make a better world and we must continue harnessing its power for peace and a better future for the region.\\n\\n“The innovation center that we are inaugurating today proudly presents Israel’s greatest achievements, showcasing the effects of our innovation around the world,” he concluded.'},\n",

Now, with this success in hand, the company continues to position itself as a dedicated conservation-oriented company.More than 30 years ago, SeaTrek pioneered small-scale expedition cruising in Indonesia with the dream of providing people with a unique opportunity to explore this beautiful remote part of the world by offering intimate adventure voyages. Ever since, social and environmental responsibility has been one of the core values to the company. Its cooperation with Kopernik in the providing of water filters and solar lamps has serious benefit to the lives of many people in the far-flung corners of the country.The company feels a strong responsibility for the oceans and communities of the archipelago and indeed this stewardship is at the very essence of its business. Knowing that plastic pollution is one of the biggest threats is just one example, and SeaTrek is actively taking steps to preserve the unique marine environment, which reveals astonishing natural wonders to employees and guests alike.The company has recently teamed up with Indigo V, an organisation that encourages citizen science through boat owners to drag for micro plastics and microscopic biota while being out on the ocean. The Ombak Putih, one of SeaTrek’s two traditional motor sailors, is now equipped with a sustainably powered auto-sampling device provided by Indigo V that will filter out micro plastics from the sea. Guests on board can participate by collecting the filtrate and see the effect that plastic has on the environment at first hand. As part of a world-wide programme, the collected data is sent to the headquarters of Indigo V and will help to identify the amount of plastic in the ocean as well as the “footprint” of the polluters.Furthermore, Frank Hyde, director of SeaTrek Sailing Adventures, is proud to announce that the company was recently accredited with three “Starfish” out of a possible five in WWF’s Signing Blue programme, officially showing that the business is run according to the long-term health of communities and natural habitats on and around the waters of Indonesia.Apart from taking actions themselves, SeaTrek also provides various sponsorship opportunities for NGOs who care for the environment. For example, the company supports NGOs like Water1st International, U.S. Wildlife Trafficking Alliance and CREST (Center for Responsible Travel) by donating cabins for auction.They also take this commitment to the grass roots level by supporting local people who are protecting their environment at the simplest of levels; be it saving giant coconut crabs from hunters on remote islands or bringing tourists to see birds of paradise in their forests – these local heroes, are the embodiment of stewardship, showing that by protecting local resources and making wildlife worth more alive than dead, they can help provide employment and increased livelihood for themselves while at the same time preserving the wonderful bounty of nature that surrounds them.By providing these opportunities for their guests, SeaTrek hopes to create ambassadors for conservation, and a hope for a better more sustainable world.For detailed information on SeaTrek Sailing Adventures, please visit www.seatrekbali.com For further information about the NGOs and companies mentioned in the press release, please visitAboard the UNESCO World Heritage wooden pinisi sailing ships of Indonesia, SeaTrek Sailing Adventures follow the historic trading routes and the trade winds to bring guests in comfort and style on engaging, high-content cruises to remote areas where they are unplugged and immersed in the cultural and natural wonders of the world’s longest and most biodiverse archipelago. From Bali to the far flung reaches of Papua, life on board their two traditional pinisi ships, is one of relaxation and comfort, with six and twelve cabins on the Katharina and Ombak Putih, respectively, guests enjoy fresh local and international cuisine, attentive service, and fine company mixed with plenty of adventure, culture, water sports, history, wildlife, culture and tropical exploration – and all combined with a strong commitment to conserving the natural environment, the local cultures, and the unique wildlife of Indonesia.Tourism UnlimitedJudith HoppePartnerSchmid-Wildy-Weg 4681739 MunichGermanyph: +49-89-673 78 619'},\n",

The other four winning artists are from the US, Japan, Indonesia, and Ecuador.\\n\\nJeuz, who is currently an AB Multimedia Arts student at the University of Mindanao, will receive $2,000 as the grand prize. What does he think about his win? And what's he going to do with the cash prize?\\n\\nCheck out his interview here:\\n\\nWhat motivated you to compete in the Venom art contest?\\n\\nJS: I got excited when I saw the creative invite was for Venom. Kasi pag sinabing Venom character, ang unang maiisip mo talaga is mabangis, malupit, kaya nakaka excite i- illustrate. However, due to my school load, I wasn’t able to immediately create. Good thing with Talenthouse, the deadline is a month after the invite, giving me enough time to finish my entry.\\n\\nDo you always join art competitions, whether for Talenthouse or in general? Tell us about your experiences.\\n\\nJS: Yes, I learned about Talenthouse only last February through our college professor, Sir James Racho. He’s also a graphic artist and has joined Talenthouse contests in the past. Sabi nya try ko lang daw, kasi maraming magagaling at sobrang worth it ng prizes. Another person who inspired me when it comes to digital illustration is Sir Harrison Espina. I got envious -- in positive way -- when I saw his works in Talenthouse. It motivated me to strive harder and get better, and since then, I’ve been joining creative invites of Talenthouse, from February 2018 up to the present. Luckily, there’s been progress in my artworks.\\n\\nWhat did you think were your chances after seeing the other entries for Venom?\\n\\nJS: To be honest, I didn’t expect to win because the submissions were really impressive. You can see from the entries that some of the artists are already professionals, with complete top-level tools. My only weapon is my unique concept, and that’s where I anchored my hopes. While other entries had busy and elaborate ideas, I made mine purposely minimalist. I observed in past contests that the winning designs were simple and didn’t go to extremes, but rather relied on strong concepts and proper execution.\\n\\nAre you familiar with Venom comics and character? If yes, what do you like about him? Who are your other favorite Marvel characters?\\n\\nJS: Yes I’m familiar with Venom, I find him very unique, and I like that he’s an anti-hero. He exudes an intimidating, invincible vibe. “Bangis” is how I’d describe him. My favorite Marvel superhero is Thor, followed by Iron Man.\\n\\nHow did you conceptualize your Venom entry? What is the story behind it?\\n\\nJS: First I had to think of something that can stand for a metaphor to the character of Venom. I watched the Venom trailer ten times while brainstorming. Then I hit on the idea of illustrating Venom as a shadow, a metaphor for a person’s dark side, which I think all of us have, we just don’t show or acknowledge it. That’s why I illustrated Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) looking at his hands as if clueless, lost and wondering what’s happening to him. However, Eddie’s shadow is in the form of Venom, who in contrast is smiling and perfectly aware of what’s going on. I haven’t seen the film, but based on the trailer, I think the film is about facing, accepting and embracing your dark side. It doesn't mean if meron ka nagawang masama or may dark past ka noon, di ka na pwede gumawa ng mabuti at mamuhay ng malaya. It's about turning it into positive and learning from it, making it as your greatest strength in life.\\n\\nDo you consider yourself a digital artist? Do you also hand-draw? What’s your preferred process?\\n\\nJS: With this victory, perhaps I can consider myself a digital artist. I also do hand-drawing, like basing sketching, painting, etc. Actually I only started exploring digital art last November when I got my laptop. That’s when I invested time practicing and exploring software used in illustrating. Thanks to my classmates who taught me the basics about digital illustration.\\n\\nWhat do you plan to do with your US dollar cash prize?\\n\\nJS: I’d probably invest in my tools, like upgrade the specs of my laptop, buy pen tablet to speed up the process because it takes so long with just using a mouse. I also want to take my family out and “treat” friends who’ve been very supportive.\\n\\nWhat’s your advice for aspiring artists?\\n\\nJS: Envy is a good motivator, so I’d encourage them to be envious of the artists they look up to, and then channel the envy to practice harder and keep on creating. Be humble always, whatever you’ve achieved, always have that humilty inside of you. Always have Faith in God, because our talents came from Him. We are but His instruments in showing everyone the beauty of life through the art that we’re sharing.

Photo courtesy of Tanamera/NOW!JAKARTA\\n\\nFirst of all congratulations on your continued expansion. I hear that three more stores are being opened. But let’s start at the beginning: why coffee? Is that your background, or your passion?\\n\\nI’ve always liked the F&B Industry and I love drinking good coffee. I saw there was an opportunity to prove how good Indonesian coffee can be, so my mission was—and still is—to have Specialty Grade Indonesia Arabica Coffee recognised and craved internationally! In time I hope we produce a lot more high quality coffee as a nation and, in turn, help raise the living standards for our many coffee farmers.\\n\\nCoffee is not only popular in Indonesia, it’s almost an obsession, but isn’t the competition really very high? Isn’t this a tough business?\\n\\nYes, coffee is very competitive, but I believe Indonesia has a uniqueness with the beans from Sabang to Marauke thats makes us different from other countries. We are one of the few coffee businesses that focuses solely on Indonesian coffee. I always believe we will continue to succeed and can prove internationally how good Indonesian coffee can be when following the right processes.\\n\\nTanamera is the true definition of Indonesian coffee.\\n\\nWhat makes you sure that the Tanamera brand is distinctive enough to compete with the many brands out there? What are your unique brand strengths?\\n\\nKey to our brand is consistently good coffee. I believe strongly in ensuring strict processing for the supply of green beans as these contribute 60 per cent to the quality of a cup of coffee. So our efforts working directly with the farmers to achieve high quality is a standout feature of Tanamera Coffee. Also our commitment to using the best equipment and people for roasting through to serving your cup of delicious Indonesian coffee.\\n\\nYou are now working on your tenth store, where are they and what factors decided you to choose the locations?\\n\\nYes we have 10 stores already open, with six in Jakarta at the moment (Thamrin, Serpong, Kebayoran, Pantai Indah Kapuk, Pacific Place, Mega Kuningan, plus Bali, Makassar, Yogyakarta and Surabaya. We will open two more stores before the end of the year. One in Kemang and Surabaya (designed by Andra Matin). We are really looking forward to Surabaya as it is our first complete build and have another great partner there to execute this. We have had lots of sites offered to Tanamera so we have been getting better at choosing successful locations! First we need to ensure the location meets our customer profile and then we need to ensure we can build to our standard that makes our customers comfortable.\\n\\nDo you have special training for Tanamera operatives? Is it back of house or front? What special skills do they have?\\n\\nWe have a full management & technical team, so before a launch we always make sure every team member is fully trained and we always regularly audit and check each store to make sure we are consistent across the brand. The special skill is having the sensory ability for all our baristas and then their operating skills for grinder calibration through to the coffee making.\\n\\n\\n\\nDini Aryani Criddle, the founder of Tanamera Coffee with the coffee farmer in Bali plantation.\\n\\nI understand you have created special relationships with your coffee farmers. Can you tell me about these?\\n\\nWe are very serious in our working relationship with the farmers, sharing knowledge, having regular visits to the plantations and showing/discussing what we need to achieve international standards. We have been working hard in Bali on a farm processing model that can be shared across many farmers/locations at a relatively low capital outlay to help produce more higher quality coffee. The farm is in Kintamani, Bali. It’s very exciting and we are looking to doing a lot more each year going forward.\\n\\nHow would you describe the experience that I will have when entering a Tanamera store?\\n\\nIt is not only coffee, its the whole experience. Friendly baristas, nice decor, a red flower on each table, good music, and of course the most important thing— ‘good coffee’ from across the Indonesian Archipelago!\\n\\nWhat about the future? Are you able to share your plans?\\n\\nIn 2019 we will continue to open more stores (several are already underway) and we can’t wait to open our first overseas outlet! We also have several new coffee products coming, it’s all very exciting!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_______\\n\\nThis article is originally from paper.

Photo by Raditya Fadilla/NOW!JAKARTA\\n\\nNewly opened Kalture is one such gem. Located in a residential tower, but easily accessed on the public road, the restaurant is mostly Indian but with several Asian twists. The warm colours of the well-appointed main dining area welcome guests into a space that features seating for couples, families and large groups.\\n\\nSaddle up here and order a drink as you peruse a menu rife with both Indian and Asian favourites - and be assured anything you order here is bound to be delicious.\\n\\nGeetika Sainani, who is credited with cooking for India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to Jakarta earlier this year, has put together a menu that combines both North Indian and Asian riches. The recipes are her own and the dishes featured during my visit were executed with aplomb.\\n\\nTo start there's the Caesar salad. The humble chicken and lettuce combination are taken to another level with tandoori chicken and quail eggs, which give it a different flavour while still retaining authenticity.\\n\\nFor mains, it's best to order a few dishes. There's the pizza, essentially well-cooked naan with just the right amount of butter, topped with cheese and a chicken tikka sauce. For something more traditional there's chicken biryani. Sainani's recipe is excellent and the dish is rendered perfectly. There is an unofficial rule that says that an Indian restaurant is judged by the quality of its biryani. In this case, Kalture is a clear winner.\\n\\nIn keeping with its name - a play on the word culture, to represent the area's vibrant, multi-cultural set, do order the bibim bap. This Korean dish here is a vegetarian version - the meat is replaced with soy granules. Served with a variety of sauces, kimchi and vegetables, the dish is a perfect rendition of the classic - and you won't miss the meat!\\n\\nIndian desserts are often rich, milky and syrupy. Not necessarily negatives but they can often be intense. At Kalture, however, the dessert platter - which includes a generous serve of Kulfi, an Indian, pistachio crusted ice cream, and Gulab Jamun (sweet milk balls in syrup) are not overwhelming and provide the requisite sweet finish. Creatively adorned with a saffron sauce and a splash of raspberry coulis the dish is as delicious as it is pretty.\\n\\nThere are plenty of wonderful dishes to try here, and as you sip your masala chai to finish off this delicious repast, I'm pretty sure you'll be planning your next visit!\\n\\nKalture\\n\\nParadiso\\n\\nWest Cilandak, Jakarta\\n\\nT: +62-21 22706042\"},\n",

SL, the two importers of furniture products, were handed over by Indonesian President Joko Widodo during the opening ceremony of the 33rd Indonesian Trade Expo in Tangerang, Banten, on Wednesday (Oct 24).\\n\\n\\n\\nIndonesian Ambassador to Spain Hermono will present the Primaduta Award to the winners during a reception at the Indonesian Embassy in Madrid in November 2018.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Primaduta Award is one of the government`s programs to boost the growth of Indonesian exports to global markets.\\n\\n\\n\\nAmbassador Hermono remarked that the accolades for the two Spanish importers demonstrated the continuity in trade relations between Indonesia and Spain as well as proved that the quality and supply of Indonesian products are well maintained.\\n\\n\\n\\nData from Spain`s Global Trade Atlas show that Spain`s imports of furniture products from Indonesia during the January-July 2017 period were valued at US$20,417,091, while during the same period in 2018, the value was recorded at $20,453,938, or increased by 0.18 percent.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe percentage rise is because not only do these imported products cater to the Spanish market but also other European countries.\\n\\n\\n\\nSpanish furniture exports in 2017 were recorded at $865,857,325. In 2018, the value increased to $911,157,640, or up by 5.23 percent. This is an opportunity for Indonesia to increase the export volume of furniture products to Spain.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Primaduta Award`s selection was based on the role of nominees in improving Indonesia`s export performance to the destination country, the performance of nominees in increasing the exports of imported products, and the types of goods imported from Indonesia.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe government is optimistic that the 2018 Primaduta Award would further encourage importers and exporters of both countries to further increase the export volume of Indonesian products to Spain.\\n\\n\\n\\nIndonesia`s exports during the 2015-2017 period had increased from $1,481,288,148 to $2,011,925,576.\\n\\n\\n\\nReporting by Zeynita Gibbons\\n\\nEditing by Libertina WA'},\n",
